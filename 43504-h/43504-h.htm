<p>One notable effect of “Life in London,” particularly in its dramatised
form must be recorded. It broke the heart of poor Billy Waters, the
one-legged musical negro, who died in St. Giles’s workhouse, whispering
with his ebbing breath, a mild anathema, which sounded very much like:
“Cuss him, dam Tom&mdash;meē&mdash;Tom&mdash;meē Jerry!”</p>

<p>Poor Billy endeavoured, up to the period of his last illness, to obtain
for a wife and two children what he termed, “An honest living by scraping
de cat-gut!” by which he originally collected considerable sums of money
at the West-end of the town, where his ribbon-decked cocked hat and
feathers, with the grin on his countenance, and sudden turn and kick out
of his wooden limb, and other antics and efforts to please, excited much
mirth and attention, and were well rewarded from the pockets of John Bull.</p>

<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_t.jpg" alt="T" /></span>hat <span class="smcap">Pierce Egan’s Life in London</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Tom and Jerry</span>, was a success, we
have plenty of printed evidence and ‘hearsay’! to prove. And we also
know&mdash;beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the news of its metropolitan fame
went forth with almost telegraphic speed throughout the provinces:&mdash;From
John o’Groat’s House to the Land’s End!&mdash;From Dan to Beersheba!&mdash;and back
<i>again</i>! With <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, its language became the language of the day;
drawing-rooms were turned into <i>chaffing cribs</i>, and rank and beauty
learned to patter flash <i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>The original work went through several editions in a very short time, and
the plates, by the Brothers Cruikshank, were considered so full of
amusement that they were transferred to a variety of articles without any
loss of time. The <i>Lady</i> taking her <i>gunpowder</i> was enabled to amuse her
visitors with the adventures of <i>Tom and Jerry</i> on her highly-finished
tea-tray. The lovers of Irish <i>Blackguard</i> experienced a double zest in
taking a pinch from a box, the lid of which exhibited the laughable phiz
of the eccentric <span class="smcap">Bob Logic</span>. The country folks were delighted with the
handkerchief which displayed <span class="smcap">Tom</span> getting the best of a Charley, and <span class="smcap">Dusty
Bob</span> and <span class="smcap">Black Sal</span> “all happiness!” The <i>Female of Quality</i> felt interested
with the lively scene of the light fantastic toe at Almack’s, when playing
with her elegant fan; and the <i>Connoisseur</i>, with a smile of satisfaction
on his countenance, contemplated his screen, on which were displayed the
motley groups of high and low characters continually on the move in the
metropolis.</p>

<p>Everybody talked of <span class="smcap">Tom and Jerry</span>, and crowds rushed to the theatres where
the uproarious adventures of these popular personages were represented in
a dramatic form. Mr. W. T. Moncrieff’s adaptation brought out at the
Adelphi Theatre, November 26th, 1821:&mdash;which, “<i>by-the way</i>,” was by far
the best of the whole <i>bunch</i>!&mdash;ran uninterruptedly through two seasons.
It then appeared in rapid succession at the Theatres all over England,
Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; likewise in most of the United States of
America, the West Indies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But although <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, or, <span class="smcap">Tom and Jerry</span> did make our grandfathers
so very&mdash;<i>very!</i> merry in the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, we
are constrained to admit; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> it is a terrible dull and tedious work to
read through in the present day, and it is on that very account, that we
here place before our readers, what we are pleased to term&mdash;<span class="smcap">The True
History</span> of <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; for the work has a history of its own, and to
exemplify the fact, we have in the first place, made numerous selections
from the original work, then given the principal scenes of Moncrieff’s
dramatic version of the same, the two concluding chapters of <span class="smcap">Pierce Egan’s</span>
continuation of his <span class="smcap">Life in London</span> which he entitles&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Finish to the
Adventures of Tom, Jerry, and Logic</span>, in their Pursuits through <span class="smcap">Life In and
Out of London</span>.<a name='fna_1' id='fna_1' href='#f_1'><small>[1]</small></a> Together with
a “<span class="smcap">Key</span> to <span class="smcap">Persons</span> and <span class="smcap">Places</span>, and an
Etymological and Critical Vocabulary and Glossary of <i>Flash</i> and <i>Slang
Terms</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> occurring in the course of this work,” as at once giving an
epitome of the whole: and to our mind, sufficient to be known of <span class="smcap">Pierce
Egan’s</span> once popular work. To which we have added such historic facts and
scraps of information that have come to hand during our researches in
connection with the&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rise</span> and <span class="smcap">Progress</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Decline</span>
and <span class="smcap">Fall</span> of the <span class="smcap">Book</span> and
its <span class="smcap">Story</span>. The present generation will find in some of the scenes depicted
in such glowing colours, many of the fashions, manners and customs, which
prevailed in the reign of King George the Fourth, together with certain
landmarks of the past, which no one need regret leaving far behind, and
ought to give every encouragement to those who live under the rule of
Queen Victoria to maintain a firm faith in the social progress of the age.</p>

<p>The first <span class="smcap">Chapter</span> of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, commences with what the author terms
<span class="smcap">An Invocation</span>, in which, after <i>invoking!</i>&mdash;“the pleasing, grateful,
inspiring, nay, golden advantages resulting from the smiles of that
supreme goddess of the gods, FAME!”&mdash;which he adds is the&mdash;“flattering
unction” that all authors <i>sigh</i> to be anointed with. He then in
very&mdash;“merry-go-round&mdash;here we go round”&mdash;sort of a way calls to his aid
many of the past, and, also then, living authors, artists, publishers, and
public characters of the day&mdash;“to enrich his judgment&mdash;guide his
pen&mdash;inspire him with confidence&mdash;and in other ways assist him in the
arduous task he has undertaken.” And thus he ‘<i>invokes</i>.’ Laurence
Sterne&mdash;divine and humourist&mdash;(1713-68):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;“It is to thee, <span class="smcap">Sterne</span>, I first humbly bend my knee, and solicit thy
most powerful aid. If thou didst not <i>use up</i> all thy stock of
<span class="smcap">Sensibility</span> before thou wert called away to enjoy the reward of thy
exertions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> bowers of Elysium, pray tell me where thou didst
deposit that most precious bottle, that I may with an eagerness
unexampled, uncork its treasures and apply every drop after thy rich
felicity: I have great need of it. And <span class="smcap">Fielding</span>, too, thou true
delineator of <span class="smcap">Human Nature</span>, if only a small <i>remnant</i> of thy <span class="smcap">Mantle</span>
has been left behind, let me but know it, that I may ransack every
piece-broker’s house in the kingdom, till I become the master of such
an invaluable stimulus to exertion. And, although another <span class="smcap">Sophia
Western</span>, perhaps, is not to be met with in the walks of the present
day, if it were my precise object, yet, let me but produce some
similarity towards the <i>double</i> of a <span class="smcap">Tom Jones</span> or a <span class="smcap">Booth</span>, and the
highest pinnacle of my ambition is attained. <span class="smcap">Smollett</span>, thy touching
heartfelt qualities break in upon me so penetratingly, that I must
also invoke thy friendly shrine. And if a <span class="smcap">Rory Random</span> or a Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Bowling</span> should ever cross my path, instruct me to portray their noble
traits with all that richness of colouring, and peculiar happiness of
style, that once embellished thy truly characteristic pen.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Advance, also the Metropolitan Heroes of Literary Renown, whether
of <span class="smcap">Genius</span> great, either of <i>romantic</i> style, or of <i>Poetry</i> exquisite,
of <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span> or Lalla Rookh quality, it matters not, if <i>generosity</i>
lie within thine inkstands, and ye put forth your good wishes for my
success; show me your <i>passports</i> to excellence, and put me in the
right road, that I may ultimately obtain your proud signatures and
arrive safe at the end of my journey.</p>

<p>&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Reviews</span>, those terrific Censors of the timid writer, and arbiters
of the press, whether <span class="smcap">Quarterly</span>,<a name='fna_2' id='fna_2' href='#f_2'><small>[2]</small></a>
or at <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>,<a name='fna_3' id='fna_3' href='#f_3'><small>[3]</small></a> you who apply
the <i>knife</i>, bear it in mind that <span class="smcap">Van Butchell</span><a name='fna_4' id='fna_4' href='#f_4'><small>[4]</small></a> <i>advertises</i> to
perform <i>cures</i> without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> <i>cutting</i>;
and that <span class="smcap">Abernethy</span><a name='fna_5' id='fna_5' href='#f_5'><small>[5]</small></a> is himself
alone! and also remember, thou <i>sages</i> of the quill, that many an
unfortunate <i>homo</i> who has been ‘damned to everlasting Fame’ and
disposed of in a <i>Jef</i>, in thy most omnipotent pages; yet has, from
the <i>resuscitating</i> glossy aid of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Day &amp; Martin</span>, become a
<i>shining</i> Literary Character in Paternoster Row, and formed one of the
real Portraits of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Come forth, my <i>Mag</i> of <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span><a name='fna_6' id='fna_6' href='#f_6'><small>[6]</small></a>; thee, too, I must invoke!
thou <i>chiel</i> of <span class="smcap">Satire</span>, whose lively sallies and
‘laughing-in-the-sleeve greatness’ that would have paralysed the
pencil of a <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, or struck dumb the <i>piquant</i> ridicule of a
<span class="smcap">Churchill</span>, if the grim King of Terrors had not deprived us of their
talents; I challenge thee to the <i>scratch</i>! ’Tis <span class="smcap">One of the Fancy</span>
calls! But, from thy <i>lamb-like</i> qualities and <i>playful</i> artillery, it
must only be a private <i>set-to</i> with the <i>gloves</i>. My hand grapples
with you in friendship&mdash;it possesses not <i>weight</i> enough to combat
with thee, although the <i>pluck</i>, perhaps, attached to it may be always
<i>gay</i>. Be it remembered, that <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span> is always in <i>training</i>&mdash;he
<i>hits</i> so very hard&mdash;and his <span class="smcap">Backers</span> are likewise so numerous amongst
the Greeks, Latins, Hebrews, and Classics, that it would be two to one
against an open contest: therefore, good Mr. Blackwood, be just, nay,
be more, ‘be merciful. It is doubly bless’d’; and you know <i>Blacky</i>,
‘it blesseth him that <i>gives</i> and him that <i>takes</i>.’ Then <i>floor</i> me
not; but instead:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Shoot thine arrow o’er thy house,&mdash;<br />
And do not wound thy brother;</p>

<p>but whisper to the <span class="smcap">Pack</span>, and particularly to the <i>whipper-in</i>, Old
Christopher North, that ‘<span class="smcap">’Tis I</span>’&mdash;(your <i>flash-y</i> friend of the
South). But let me entreat of you Mr. Blackwood, to <i>bottle-off</i> a few
of thy little mastery touches (as full of fire as thy famed whisky),
and send them to me with all the speed of the mail, lest my stock of
<i>spirits</i> should be exhausted, and that <span class="smcap">Life in London</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> may be
enriched with the fine colouring of a <i>Meg Merrilees</i>, if it be only
in perspective.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“And <span class="smcap">Mr. Colburn</span> (thou indefatigable promoter of literature), thy
assistance I most humbly crave! indeed, I feel assured that thy
spirited and liberal disposition will not permit thee to omit
informing those dashing belles and beaux, whose morning lounge gives
thy repository of the mind an air of fashion, that <span class="smcap">Life in London</span> is
worthy of perusal.</p>

<p>“But thou, <span class="smcap">O Murray!</span> whose classic front defies, with terrific awe,
ill-starred, pale, wan, and <i>shabbily</i>-clad <span class="smcap">Genius</span> from approaching
thy splendid threshold, retreat a little from thy rigid reserve, and
for once open thy doors, and take the unsophisticated <span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span>
by the hand; and although not a <span class="smcap">Childe Harold</span> in birth, a <span class="smcap">Corsair</span>
bold, or a <span class="smcap">Hardy Vaux</span>, <i>wretched</i> exile; yet let me solicit thee to
introduce him to thy numerous acquaintance, that, having once obtained
thy <i>smiling</i> sanction, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> may not only have the honour of being
allowed to call again, but to offer his services throughout thy
extended circle. Grant me but this and whether in simple quires, in
humble boards, or in Russia, triumphantly gilt, so that thou promote
my fame, my gratitude attends thee, and values not the mode of thy
favours.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Christie</span>, I am sure thy goodness will not refuse me the loan of thy
<i>erudite</i> hammer, if not to <i>knock down</i>, yet to dispose of every
coarse and offensive article; nay more, let them not be numbered in
the <i>catalogue</i> of my offences.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">O Shaughnessy</span>, fashion me into thy fine attitudes and guard, to
protect me from assaults in all the hair-breath escapes I may have to
encounter in my day and midnight rambles. And thou, O mighty and
powerful champion, <span class="smcap">Cribb</span>, admired hero of the stage, teach me to make
a <i>hit</i> of so <span class="smcap">Kean</span> a quality, that it may not only <i>tell</i>, but be long
remembered in the Metropolis. And Paternoster-row triumpet forth its
praise and excellence throughout the most distant provinces.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ackerman</span>, if ever thou didst <i>value</i> the Tour of <span class="smcap">Dr. Syntax</span>, I call
upon thee now to lend thy friendly assistance and protection to
<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> and his rustic <i>protégé</i> poor <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>. Present a copy of
their <span class="smcap">Sprees</span> and <span class="smcap">Rambles</span> to the learned Doctor, and his ‘Picturesque’
brain will be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> on fire for another tour, from the new scenes it
will develop to his unbounded thirst for enterprise and knowledge.”</p>

<p>“And thou, too, <span class="smcap">Hone</span>, thou king of parodists! turn not a deaf ear to
my request, but condescendingly grant the petition of your most humble
suitor. In my diversity of research, teach me ‘how to tell my story,’
that I may not only woo the public with success and fame, but produce
that fine edge in <i>sharpening</i> up my ideas, yet, withal so smooth and
<i>oily</i>, that instead of <i>wounding</i> characters, I may merely <i>tickle</i>
them and create a smile!”</p>

<p>“<i>Tremblingly alive!</i> nay, heavily oppressed with agitation and fear,
I now intrude myself into thy presence, thou renowned hero of the
police, <span class="smcap">Townshend</span>. Do not frown upon me, but stretch out thine hand to
my assistance, thou bashaw of the <i>prigs</i> and all-but <i>beak</i>! The
satellite of kings and princes, protector of the nobility, and one of
the <i>safe guards</i> of the Metropolis. Listen to my application, I
entreat thee, ‘my knowing one,’ and for once let me take a <i>peep</i> into
thy hiden invaluable secrets. It is only a <i>glance</i> at thy <i>reader</i><a name='fna_7' id='fna_7' href='#f_7'><small>[7]</small></a>

<p class="poem">Wherein of hundreds <i>topp’d</i>, thousands lagg’d;<br />
And of the innumerable <i>teazings</i> thou has book’d.</p>

<p>thy ‘Life in London,’ alone, is a history of such magnitude, that, if

O teach me, <span class="smcap">Townsey</span>, to be as <i>down</i> in my portraits as thou art in
giving all the light and shade of criminality to the nightly mysteries
of the wary <span class="smcap">Fence</span> when pressing for a conviction; and likewise, to

anxious aid. Indeed, I have need of all your illustrative touches; and
may we be hand-and-glove together in depicting the richness of nature,
which so wantonly, at times, plays off her freaks upon half-famished
bone-rakers and cinder sifters round the dust hill, that we may be
found, <i>en passant</i>, so identified with the scene in question, as
almost to form a part of the group. May you also, <span class="smcap">Bob</span> and <span class="smcap">George</span>,
<i>grapple</i> with <i>Hogarthian</i> energy, in displaying <i>tout a la monde</i>
the sublime and <i>finished</i> part of creation, whether <i>screwed</i> up to a

welcome visitor at every residence, and likewise an admired portrait
over all the chimney-pieces in the kingdom&mdash;a <span class="smcap">Perfect Gentleman</span>. But,
before I dismiss you to your studies, bear it in remembrance, ‘nothing
to extenuate, or set down aught in malice;’ yet be tremblingly alive
to the <i>shrug</i> of the fastidious critic, who might, in his sneer,
remark, that <span class="smcap">Caricature</span> would be as much out of time and place in

master of the Cremona, to give all the force and beauty of
composition, but carefully to avoid a note being out of tune. Then,
for once, let me entreat of thee, in soliciting thy assistance, that
thou wilt take off the <i>gloves</i>, quit the prize ring, put down thy

stear clear from the <i>slang</i>,<a name='fna_10' id='fna_10' href='#f_10'><small>[10]</small></a> except, indeed, where the instances
decidedly call it forth, in order to produce an effect, and <i>emphasis</i>
of character. Then, fare thee well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>Early in the career of the publication of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, there seems to
have been some adverse criticisms by at least a section of the Press on
the <i>slang</i> of the Author; and the somewhat highly coloured and <i>spicey</i>
Plates of the Brothers Cruikshank, as in <span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span>, page 84, Part III.,
there is the following apology, or, explanation printed as a foot-note
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;“I am aware that some of my readers of a higher class of society,
may feel, or seem to think, that I have introduced a little too much
of the <i>slang</i>; but I am anxious to render myself perfectly
intelligible to all parties. Half the world are <i>up</i> to it; and it is
my intention to make the other half <i>down</i> to it. <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>
demands this sort of demonstration. A kind of <i>cant</i> phraseology is
current from one end of the Metropolis to the other: indeed, even in
the time of Lord Chesterfield, he complained of it. In some females of
the highest rank, it is as strongly marked, as in <i>dingy</i>
draggled-tail <span class="smcap">Sall</span>, who is compelled to dispose of a few sprats to
turn an honest penny: and while the latter, in smacking her lips,
talks of her <i>prime jackey</i>, an <i>out-and-out</i> concern, a <i>bit of good
truth</i>, &amp;c., the former, in her dislikes, tossing her head, observes,
it was <i>shocking</i>, <i>quite a bore</i>, <i>beastly, stuff</i>, &amp;c. The Duchess,
at an Opera, informs the Countess of a ‘<i>row</i>’ which occurred on the
last evening with as much <i>sang-froid</i>, as <span class="smcap">Carrotty Poll</span> mentions to a
<i>Costardmonger</i> the <i>lark</i> she was engaged in, at a gin-spinner’s,
and, in being turned out of the <i>panny</i>, got her <i>ogles</i> taken
<i>measure</i> of for a <i>suit of mourning</i>. Therefore, some allowance must
be made for an author who is compelled to write under a subdued tone
of expression&mdash;in order to keep his promise made to the public in the
<span class="smcap">Prospectus</span> issued by him prior to the publication of the work. In fact
in many instances, the language of real Life is so very strong,
coarse, and even disgusting, that, in consequence of keeping the above
object in view, the points of many a rich scene are in great danger of
being nearly frittered away; nay, of being almost reduced to tameness
and insipidity. My ingenious friends, <span class="smcap">Robert</span> and <span class="smcap">George Cruikshank</span>,
whose talents in representing “the living manners as they rise” stand
unrivalled in this peculiar line, feel as strongly impressed with the
value of <i>delicacy</i> as I do. But if some of the plates should appear
rather <i>warm</i>, the purchaser of ‘<span class="smcap">Life in London</span>’ may feel assured,
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> nothing is added to them tending to <i>excite</i>, but, on the
contrary, they have most anxiously, on all occasions, given the
preference rather to ‘<i>extenuate</i>’ than to ‘set down aught in malice.’
All the Plates are the exact representations, as they occurred of the
various classes of society.”</p></div>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The Prospectus alluded to at page xi., was after the following form.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;“The grand object of this Work is an attempt to portray what is
termed ‘<span class="smcap">Seeing Life</span>’ in all its various bearings upon Society; from
the <i>high mettled</i> <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> of St. James’ <i>swaddled</i> in luxury, down
to the <i>needy Flue-Faker</i> of Wapping, <i>born without a shirt</i>, and
destitute of a <i>bit of scran</i> to allay his piteous cravings. ‘<span class="smcap">Life in
London</span>’ then, is the sport in view; and provided the <i>Chase</i> is turned
to good account. ‘<span class="smcap">Seeing Life</span>’ will be found to have its <i>advantages</i>.
No leaning upon the elbows is necessary to <i>imagine scenes</i>, after the
manner of the ‘Mysteries of Udolpho,’ neither has it been deemed
expedient to have a fairy stationed upon a Lake, during the thunder
and lightning of some dreadful night, in order to work up the mind of
the Writer to depict what he has seen, with a touch of the terrific.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Designs</span> have been sketched, as they occurred, and the Artists, in
conjunction with the Writer, have booked the ‘<span class="smcap">Glowing Scene</span>, <i>fraught
with fun, gaiety, style</i>, anecdote, <i>and character</i>,’ at the moment it
presented itself, and which, if once lost sight of, perhaps, could
never have been retraced;&mdash;instead of trusting to their <i>recollection</i>
at an after period, which has too often been the cause of giving a
sort of <i>insipidity</i> and <i>dulness</i>, characterizing ‘<span class="smcaplc">STILL</span>’ instead of
the fire and animation that hovers over ‘<i>Real</i>’ LIFE.</p>

<p>“It will, also, be found that ‘<span class="smcap">Jerry</span>’ had higher objects in view, than
<i>breaking a Watchman’s lantern</i>, and agitating a <i>tinkler</i> to <i>queer</i>
the <i>Roosters</i>, or, that his energies and talents existed <i>only</i> in a
Row. It is not necessary, however, to dilate on the merits of a Work
that affords such an inexhaustible scope, as ‘Life in London;’
neither, perhaps, is it too much to conclude, that it will be a
production, at which the <span class="smcap">Grave</span> may smile, the <span class="smcap">Gay</span>
feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> delight, the
<span class="smcap">Comical</span> laugh heartily, and the <span class="smcap">Pathetic</span> have occasion for a wipe. The
<span class="smcap">Modest</span> it is trusted, will not have occasion to turn aside with
disgust, nor the <span class="smcap">Moralist</span> to shut the book offended. The <span class="smcap">Corinthians</span>
likewise, will have no occasion to be ashamed to acknowledge ‘<span class="smcap">Tom</span>’ as
one of their party; the <span class="smcap">Universities</span> not the slightest complaint to
<i>expel</i>, or even <i>rusticate</i> ‘<span class="smcap">Bob Logic</span>,’ nor the large Family of the
<span class="smcap">Hawthorns</span> to disown&mdash;poor <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, for his <span class="smcap">Sprees</span>
and <span class="smcap">Rambles</span> in the <span class="smcap">Metropolis</span>.”</p></div>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>During the periodic publication of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span> it was generally
supposed that the character-parts! of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, were portraits
of particular individuals, and there was much speculation and ink-slinging
in respect to “<i>Who is Who?</i>” In the House of Lords it was whispered that
the gallant and daring <span class="smcap">Tom</span> represented his Grace the Duke of Wellington;
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, his Grace the Duke of Buckingham; and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, no less a personage
than the Lord Chancellor. In the House of Commons it was said that <span class="smcap">Tom</span> was
intended for that worthy legal bibliophile, Mr. Butterworth, the pious
member for Coventry; that Mr. Martin of Galway, pleaded guilty to <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>;
and the acute and knowing Mr. Hume sat for the all-awake leary <span class="smcap">Logic</span>. On
the other hand it was positively asserted at the West-end that <span class="smcap">Tom</span>
<i>type-ified</i> the elegant and spirited Colonel Berkeley; that the
unsophisticated hopeful sprig of rurality, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, was drawn, <i>ad vivum</i>,
from Mr. Pea-Green Hayne,<a name='fna_11' id='fna_11' href='#f_11'><small>[11]</small></a> while <span class="smcap">Logic</span> absolutely personated that
notorious <i>modern Greek scholar</i>, the <i>learned, larking, laconic, Parson
Colton</i>.<a name='fna_12' id='fna_12' href='#f_12'><small>[12]</small></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>In the City, <i>per contra</i>, it was <i>currently reported on ’Change</i> that
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>, from his love of fun, and knowledge of good living, was the <i>locum
tenens</i> of that <i>great</i> and <i>learned</i> man, and most facetious Banking
Baronet, Sir William&mdash;more succinctly and familiarly <i>Billy</i>&mdash;Curtis, of
the “<i>three R.’s</i>” notoriety;<a name='fna_13' id='fna_13' href='#f_13'><small>[13]</small></a>&mdash;that <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was the picture of Mr.
<i>Treble</i>, <i>X</i> Sheriff Parkins; and that <span class="smcap">Logic</span> was an outline of Mr.
Alderman Wood. But, Mr. W. T. Moncrieff states that he can, however,
safely assert that all these suppositions are totally unfounded, as the
characters of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, were autobiographical sketches of the
<i>artists</i> to whom they severally originally owe their being. The talented,
spirited George Cruikshank was himself, in all the better points, the
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>&mdash;of the Corinthian Order; he is so admirably delineated; his very
clever brother Isaac Robert, then perhaps less experienced, condescended
to pass for <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, and the <i>downey</i> Pierce Egan&mdash;“‘None but himself can be
his parallel’<a name='fna_14' id='fna_14' href='#f_14'><small>[14]</small></a>&mdash;was his own <span class="smcap">Logic</span>&mdash;the Oxonian in green
specs&mdash;gig-lamps!” Mr. Moncrieff continues&mdash;“they having <i>tria juncta in
uno</i> produced the admirable foundation of this Piece.<a name='fna_15' id='fna_15' href='#f_15'><small>[15]</small></a> May they
speedily furnish the public with some more of their <i>larks</i>, <i>sprees</i> and
<i>rambles</i>&mdash;the world will thank them for the gift.”</p>

<p>It is now a matter of history that the Brothers Cruikshank, first designed
and engraved the Plates for the original Edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, and,
then, Pierce Egan wrote the letter-press up to them from month to month to
the completion of the work in July, 1821.</p>

<p>To this order of things there was, however, one exception, namely in
December, 1820,&mdash;“’twas Christmas, merry Christmas time, when ‘Man being
reasonable, must get drunk,’” and Pierce Egan, admitted that he got too
much <i>Daffy</i> aboard the over night, and that on waking up late the next
morning he found his pocket-book containing his <i>Notes!</i> <i>i.e.</i>, “copy”
absent without leave. He therefore published at page 275 as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>My numerous and dearest Friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of necessity, I am compelled to state to you, that having accepted an
invitation from <span class="smcap">Bob Logic</span>, about three weeks since, to spend an
evening with him and a few of his <i>Swell Pals</i>, at the <i>Albany</i>, I
pleaded business, and that the “<i>First of the Month</i>” must come. “I
know it,” replied <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, “but it shall be a <i>sober</i> set-out: <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>, you
shall <i>tipple</i> as you like.” In consequence of <span class="smcap">Bob’s</span> <i>plausibility</i>, I
was <i>gammoned</i> to be one of the <i>squad</i>. Mixed liquors and <i>steamers</i>
were the order of the <i>darkey</i>. But he praised so highly a cargo of
<i>daffy</i>, which he had just received from the <span class="smcap">Nonpareil</span><a name='fna_17' id='fna_17' href='#f_17'><small>[17]</small></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>that
<i>Daffy</i> and <i>water</i> was the preferred <i>suit</i>. After a glass or two had
been <i>sluiced</i> over the <i>ivories</i> of the party, which made some of
them begin loudly to <i>chaff</i>, <span class="smcap">Bob</span> gave the <i>wink</i> to his <i>slavey</i>,
observing that more hot water was wanted. A large kettle, boiling at
the spout, was speedily introduced, but instead of <i>water</i> read
<i>boiling Daffy</i>. The assumed gravity of <span class="smcap">Bob’s</span> <i>mug</i> upon playing off
this <i>trick</i> was quite a treat, but I am happy to say <i>Crooky
booked</i><a name='fna_18' id='fna_18' href='#f_18'><small>[18]</small></a> it. “Come, gents,” said <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, “please yourselves, here is
plenty of water, now mix away.” It had the desired effect. The glass
was pushed about so quickly; that the “First of the Month” was soon
<i>forgotten</i>, and we kept it up till very long after the <span class="smcap">Regulars</span> had
been <i>tucked</i> up in their <i>dabs</i>, and only the <i>Roosters</i> and the
“<i>Peep-o’-Day-Boys</i>” were out on the prowl for a <i>spree</i>. At length a
<i>move</i> was made, but not a <i>rattler</i> was to be had. <span class="smcap">Bob</span> and the party,
<i>chaffing</i>, proposed to see the <i>Author</i> safe to his <i>sky-parlour</i>.
The boys were <i>primed</i> for anything. Upon turning the corner of
<i>Sydney’s Alley</i>, into Leicester-Fields,<a name='fna_19' id='fna_19' href='#f_19'><small>[19]</small></a> we were assailed by some
<i>trouble customers</i>, and a <i>turn-up</i> was the result (as the Plate<a name='fna_20' id='fna_20' href='#f_20'><small>[20]</small></a>
most accurately represents). <span class="smcap">Bob</span> got a <i>stinker</i>, and poor I received
a <i>chancery-suit</i> upon the <i>nob</i>. How I reached the <i>upper-story</i>, I
know not; but, on waking late in the day, I found my pocket-book was
absent&mdash;without leave. I was in great grief at its loss, not on
account of the <i>blunt</i> it contained&mdash;much worse&mdash;the <i>notes</i> in it
were dearer than gold to me. The account of <span class="smcap">Jerry’s</span> introduction to
the Marchioness of Diamonds, the Duchess of Hearts, Lady Wanton, Dick
Trifle, Bill Dash, &amp;c., &amp;c., on his appearance in Rotten Row with the
<span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>, <i>booked</i> on the spot. I was in a complete <i>funk</i>. I
immediately went to <i>sartain persons</i>, and communicated my loss;
<i>how</i>, <i>where</i>, and <i>when</i>; and I was consoled, that, if it were safe,
<span class="smcap">Pierce Egan</span> should have it. Day after day passed, and no account of
it;&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> gave it up for lost, and scratched my <i>moppery</i>, again and
<i>again</i>, but could not recollect <i>accurately</i>, the substance of my
notes. I was sorry for myself;&mdash;I was sorry for the public. However,
on Friday morning last, taking a <i>turn</i> into Paternoster Row, my
friend Jones<a name='fna_21' id='fna_21' href='#f_21'><small>[21]</small></a> smiling, said he had got the Book:&mdash;as he is fond of
a bit of <i>gig</i>, I thought he was in <i>fun</i>,&mdash;but, on handing it over to
me, with the following letter, my <i>peepers</i> twinkled again with
delight.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the care of Mr. Jones, for</i> <span class="smcap">P. Egan</span>.</p>

<p>In consequence of <span class="smcap">Bob Logic’s</span> <i>Daffy</i>, only one sheet of Letter Press

<p>I therefore trust, under the circumstances of the case, a liberal
allowance will be made, when it is recollected that such RAMBLES and

original <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, there is such a graphic
description of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>&mdash;the <i>Oxonian</i>; making a “<i>jolly</i>
<span class="smcap">Night</span> <i>of it</i>” at the once famed Vauxhall Gardens: written in so truly a
<i>Piercy Egania!!!</i> style that we are tempted to reproduce it in its
entirety for the benefit of our readers, together with a few <i>Notes</i> of
our own to follow.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>&mdash;&mdash;“I perceive,” said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, “on perusing the newspaper, Vauxhall
Gardens are open, and therefore, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, to-night we will pay them a
visit.” “It is an extraordinary place, indeed,” replied <span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>, “if
my <i>Old Dad</i> and <i>Mam</i> have not exaggerated its grandeur; but, as the
<i>old people</i> have not been used to <i>sights</i>, it may account for their
astonishment and rapture in speaking about them.” “I am not surprised
at that,” answered <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, smiling; “in my humble opinion, it has not its
equal in the world. There is nothing like it in Paris. <span class="smcap">Pleasure</span> holds
her court at <i>Vauxhall</i>. In those gay regions, you are liable to
jostle against the <i>gods</i> and <i>goddesses</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> you will find
frequently at your elbow&mdash;<span class="smcap">Venus</span> and the <i>Graces</i> passing and
repassing, yet condescendingly <i>smiling</i> upon you&mdash;<span class="smcap">Momus</span> surrounded by
fun and laughter&mdash;<span class="smcap">Terpsichore</span> attending upon your <i>steps</i>&mdash;and <span class="smcap">Apollo</span>
winding up the whole with the most pleasing harmony.” “<span class="smcap">No Lethe</span>, then
is necessary at Vauxhall, I suppose,” said <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, ironically,
interrupting <span class="smcap">Tom</span>. “Yes, my dear <span class="smcap">Coz</span>,” answered the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>. “It
might be inferred that nearly, if not all the visitors, upon entering
Vauxhall Gardens, had drank of the waters of <span class="smcap">Lethe</span>, for everything
else seems to be <i>forgotten</i> on joining this enchanting scene:
however, I can speak for myself in this respect.” “Excellently well
defined, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>,” replied <span class="smcap">Logic</span>. “To me, Vauxhall is the festival of <span class="smcap">Love</span>
and <span class="smcap">Harmony</span>, and produces a most happy mixture of society. There is no
<i>precision</i> about it, and every person can be <i>accommodated</i>, however
<i>substantial</i>, or <i>light</i> and <i>airy</i> their <i>palates</i>. If <i>eating</i>, my
dear <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, is the object in view, you will perceive tables laid out
in every box, and the order is only wanted by the waiter instantly to
gratify the appetite. If <i>drinking</i>, the <i>punch</i> is so prime, and
immediately follows the call, that it will soon make you as lively as
a harlequin. If inclined to <i>waltz</i> or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> <i>reel</i>, partners can be
procured without the formality of a master of the ceremonies. If you
are fond of <i>singing</i>, the notes of that ever-green, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bland</span>, never
fail to touch the heart. If attached to <i>music</i>, the able performers
in the orchestra, the Pandean minstrels, and regimental bands, in
various parts of the gardens, prove quite a treat. If <i>promenading</i> is
your <i>forte</i>, you will find illuminated walks of the most interesting
and animated description. Numerous persons of the highest quality:
myriads of lovely females, with gaiety beaming upon every countenance;
and the pleasure of meeting with old friends and acquaintances, render
the <i>tout ensemble</i> impressively elegant and fascinating. Even the
<i>connoisseur</i> in paintings may find subjects at Vauxhall too rich to
be passed over in haste. In short, there is such an endless variety of
amusements, in rapid succession, from the song to the dance&mdash;from
refreshment to the glass&mdash;from the cascade to the fireworks, that time
positively flies in these Gardens. <i>Reflection</i> is not admitted; and
the <i>senses</i> are all upon the alert. You may be as <i>extravagant</i> as
you please, or you need not spend a single <i>farthing</i>, if economy is
your object, and not be found fault with neither. If you like it so
best,” continued the <i>Oxonian</i>, smiling, “you may be as gay as a
dancing-master, and enter into all the fun and frolic by which you are
surrounded; or you can be as <i>decorous</i> as a parson in his pulpit, and
be nothing more than a common observer. But if <i>enjoyment</i> is your
<i>motto</i>, you may make the most of an evening in these Gardens more
than at any other place in the Metropolis. It is all free and
easy&mdash;stay as long as you like, and depart when you think proper.”
“Your description is so flattering,” replied <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, “that I do not
care how soon the time arrives for us to start.” <span class="smcap">Logic</span> proposed a “bit
of a stroll,” in order to get rid of an hour or two, which was
immediately accepted by <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>. A <i>turn</i> or two in Bond
Street&mdash;a <i>stroll</i> through Piccadilly&mdash;a “<i>look in</i>” at
Tattersall’s&mdash;a <i>ramble</i> through Pall Mall&mdash;and a <i>strut</i> on the
<i>Corinthian Path</i>, fully occupied the time of our heroes till the hour
for dinner arrived, when a few glasses of <span class="smcap">Tom’s</span> rich wines soon put
them on the <i>qui vive</i>; <span class="smcap">Vauxhall</span> was then the object in view, and the
<span class="smcap">Trio</span> started, bent upon enjoying all the pleasures which this place so
amply affords to its visitors.</p>

<p>“It is really delightful,” exclaimed <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, on his entering the
Gardens, during the first act of the concert; “I was, on my first
visit, enraptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> with Sydney Gardens, at Bath; but, I must confess,
that the brilliancy of this scene is so superior that it appears to me
like a <span class="smcap">New World</span>, and you have not, my friends, <i>overrated</i> it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>, under the guidance of his <i>pals</i>, was not long in exploring
the illuminated walks, the rotunda, and everything belonging to this
fashionable place of resort. Our hero was in high spirits; <span class="smcap">Logic</span> was
also <i>ripe</i> for a <i>spree</i>; and the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> so agreeable in
disposition, that he made known to his two friends he was ready to
<i>accommodate</i> them in any proposition they might feel inclined to
make. <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> expressed himself much pleased with the arrangement and
performance of the concert; and he likewise observed, the music of the
songs reflected considerable credit on the talents of the
composer.<a name='fna_26' id='fna_26' href='#f_26'><small>[26]</small></a> On passing through the rooms attached to the rotunda, in
which the paintings of <i>Hogarth</i> and <i>Hayman</i><a name='fna_27' id='fna_27' href='#f_27'><small>[27]</small></a> are exhibited, and
also the portraits of the late King and Queen, on their coming to the
throne, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, with a smile, retorted upon <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, “that those
paintings certainly could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> not be passed over in haste, if the
proprietors of the <i>Gardens</i> thought <i>catalogues</i> were not necessary,
it would, however, prove much more pleasing to the visitors if a few
lines were painted under them, by way of <i>explanation</i>.” “I must agree
with your remarks,” replied <span class="smcap">Logic</span>; “no visitor ought to be suffered to
remain in the <i>dark</i> on any subject amidst such a blaze of
illumination. Never mind criticising any more about these pictures;
let us retire to a nice little box, for I assure you my <i>ogles</i> have
feasted enough, and I stand in need of much more substantial
refreshment. Some burnt-wine, <i>ham shavings</i>,<a name='fna_28' id='fna_28' href='#f_28'><small>[28]</small></a> chickens, sherry,
and a lively drop of arrack-punch, my boys, will enable us to finish
the evening like <i>trumps</i>.” “A good proposition,” cried <span class="smcap">Tom</span>. “It is,”
said <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; “and I second it.” The <span class="smcap">Trio</span> immediately left the <i>gay</i>
scene, for a short period, to partake of all the <i>choice</i> articles
which the larder could produce to please their palates. The <i>bottle</i>
was not suffered to stand still by our heroes, and the <i>punch</i> also
moved off with great facility, till the lively military band invited
them once more to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> join the merry dance, when <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, full of fun and
laughter, said, “he was now able to <i>reel</i> with any lady or gentleman
in the Gardens.” “Yes,” replied <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, laughing heartily, “I’ll back you
on that score, <span class="smcap">Bob</span>; but not to <i>dance</i>.” The elegant appearance and
address of the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> soon procured him lots of dashing partners:
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was not behind his <span class="smcap">Coz</span> in that respect; and the agility both our
heroes displayed on the “light fantastic toe” attracted numerous
<i>gazers</i>. <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, who was for “pushing along, keep moving,” as he
termed it, was interrupted in his pursuit by a <i>jack-o’-dandy</i> hero,
and who also quizzed the <i>Oxonian</i> with the appellation of “<i>Old
Barnacles</i>.” Some sharp words passed in reply from <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, when the
<i>dandy</i>, who was rather <i>snuffy</i>, as well as impudent, put himself
into a posture of defence, crying out, “Come on my fine <i>fealow</i>, I’ll
soon spoil your daylights.” The <i>Oxonian</i> immediately gave the <i>dandy</i>
so severe a blow on his head that he measured his length on the ground
like a log of wood: and, on <span class="smcap">Logic</span> perceiving the fallen <i>dandy</i> quite
terrified, he assumed to be in a most violent rage, and addressing two
of the sisterhood near him, with “My dears, if you do not hold my
arms, I am so tremendous a fellow, I shall certainly do him a
mischief.” This piece of bombast had the desired effect; and the
<i>dandy</i>, amidst roars of laughter, endeavoured to get up and run away;
but <span class="smcap">Logic</span> held him, and said, “That was the way he took to <i>correct</i>
fellows who addressed him improperly; and, to prevent mistakes in
future, he advised him to remember Mr. <i>Green Specs</i>.” The <i>Oxonian</i>,
anxious to keep up the fun, pretended, all of a sudden, to be in great
agony, and, putting up his hand to his head, exclaimed, in a piteous
tone, “I have got the worst of it after all; I have lost an eye.” “I
hope not,” said a lady, a little advanced in years, who was an
observer of the scene, apparently much grieved at his misfortune.
“Never mind, my love,” replied <span class="smcap">Logic</span>; “it is only a <i>green</i> one; I can
get another,” showing his spectacles, with one of his glasses out. <span class="smcap">Bob</span>
now <i>reeled</i> off, receiving the applause of the spectators as a very
funny fellow. On the conclusion of the dance, <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> traversed
the Gardens, and enjoyed themselves to the utmost extent in all the
variety they afforded, till day-light had long given them the hint it
was time to think of home. <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, as upon former occasions, was not to
be found; and the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> and his <span class="smcap">Coz</span> were compelled to leave
Vauxhall without him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>VAUXHALL.</i></p>

<p>Vauxhall Gardens&mdash;the gay and favourite spot of metropolitan amusement,
and of fashionable resort in the summer season&mdash;commenced their
attractions to the public on Monday. The weather was highly favourable.
The entertainments of the evening commenced with a <i>petit</i> piece <i>Actors’
Al Fresco; or, The Play in The Pleasure Grounds</i>, by Mr. Moncrieffe. It
was received favourably, though certainly not possessing such claims to
public favour as one might expect from the popular author of <i>Tom and
Jerry, Don Giovanni, &amp;c.</i> The Concert consisted of entirely new songs,
duets, glees, &amp;c., composed by Horn, Cooke, and Blewitt; one of the
songs&mdash;a comic one&mdash;the composition of Blewitt, possessed more merit, both
as to the words and the music, than compositions for a temporary occasion,
like the present, usually do. The space afforded to the public for a view
of the fire-works was more limited than hitherto. This contracted
allowance of accommodation, we understand, is attributable to arrangements
which are making to celebrate the approaching anniversary of the Battle of
Waterloo, on a scale of unequalled brilliancy and splendour. The boxes and
several compartments in the gardens are painted in a pleasing light
colour&mdash;a mixture of green and white&mdash;which imparts a freshness and rural
appearance to the scene, far more agreeable to the eye than the gaudy
tints which were adopted in the previous decorations.&mdash;<i>Bell’s Life in
London.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Royal Gardens, Vauxhall.</span>&mdash;The Proprietors respectfully acquaint the
Public, that it is their intention to celebrate this Anniversary
TO-MORROW, Monday, 21st July, 1828, in a style very superior indeed to any
Gala it has ever been in their power of producing, as they are enabled to
embrace all the distinguished characteristics of the Spanish Fete, in
which the Royal, Noble, and distinguished Visitors were so highly
delighted on the 8th instant. The ANNIVERSARY of the CORONATION of His
MAJESTY may therefore be termed a Superb Repetition of the brilliant
Illuminations, extensive and novel Decorations, &amp;c., &amp;c., of that night;
and the Public are assured, that the most splendid preparations are in
progress, to entertain, delight, and surprise the Visitors. The Gardens
will be made one entire scene of light, by every avenue and walk
exhibiting illuminated Ornaments, Mottoes, &amp;c., &amp;c., in variegated Lamps
and Transparencies; and the following is a slight Programme of the Night’s
Amusements:&mdash;</p>

<p>THE HYDROPYRIC EXHIBITION, which increases nightly in the favour of the
Public, will be performed with all its numerous cascades of coloured fire
and variegated water.</p>

<p>A NEW VAUDEVILLE, in the Rotunda Theatre. The Songs, Duets, &amp;c., adapted
to familiar Airs; previously to which Master Charles will perform a Solo
on the Violin.</p>

<p>RAMO SAMEE, the wonderful Indian Juggler, will delight the Company with
his surprising performances with Knives, Balls, Pyramids, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>A SUPERB DISPLAY of FIRE-WORKS will take place immediately after the
Concert. The Proprietors pride themselves much upon the universal
approbation and delight afforded by the displays of Fire-Works at
Vauxhall, and which can be witnessed at no other place of amusement in the
kingdom; and they pledge themselves that the Fire-Works of this Evening
shall be of the very first character. The Artist has directions
(regardless of expense) to produce the most splendid display.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early part of the year 1820, the British public were informed
through the then existing usual advertising mediums that there was about
to be published, in monthly parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> “<span class="smcap">Pierce Egan’s Life in London</span>; or, the
Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq.; and his elegant friend
Corinthian Tom, accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in their Rambles
and Sprees through the Metropolis. Embellished with thirty-six Scenes from
Real Life, designed and etched by I. R. and G. Cruikshank, and enriched
with numerous original Designs on Wood by the same Artists.”</p>

<p>Some time previous to its appearance a great taste had exhibited itself
amongst fashionable bloods for sporting works&mdash;books upon the chase, upon
racing, upon boxing, and ‘sport’ generally. The demand soon brought an
excellent supply, and “<span class="smcap">Boxiana</span>,” in its own peculiar department, at once
became a great favourite. Artists, too, arose, who devoted all their
powers to hunting subjects, to racing favourites, and pugilistic
encounters. Amongst these the names of Alkén, Dighton, Heath, Brooke,
Rowlandson, &amp;c., became very popular. One day it occurred to the editor of
‘Boxiana’ that if Londoners were so anxious for books about country and
out-of-door sports, why should not Provincials and even Cockneys
themselves be equally anxious to know something of “Life in London?” The
editor of ‘Boxiana’ was Mr. Pierce Egan, who as the literary
representative of sport and high life, had already been introduced to
George IV., the character of the proposed work was mentioned to the King
and his Gracious Majesty seems to have heartily approved of it, for he at
once gave permission for it to be dedicated to himself. The services of
Messrs. George and Robert Cruikshank were secured as illustrators.</p>

<p>And on the 15th July, the first number, price one shilling, was published
by Messrs. Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, of Paternoster Row. This sample, or
first instalment, of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> work was quite enough for society to
judge by. It took both town and country by storm. It was found to be the
exact thing in literature that the readers of those days wanted. Edition
after edition was called for&mdash;and supplied, as fast as the illustrations
could be got away from the small army of women and children who were
colouring them. With the appearance of numbers two and three, the demand
increased, and a revolution in our literature, in our drama, and even in
our nomenclature began to develope itself. All the announcements from
Paternoster Row were of books, great and small, depicting life in London;
dramatists at once turned their attention to the same subject, and
tailors, bootmakers, and hatters, recommended nothing but Corinthian
shapes, and Tom and Jerry patterns.<a name='fna_29' id='fna_29' href='#f_29'><small>[29]</small></a></p>

<p>Immediately Messrs. Sherwood and Co. issued the first shilling number of
Mr. Pierce Egan’s work, out came Jones and Co., of Finsbury Square, with
the following in sixpenny numbers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REAL LIFE IN LONDON;</p>

<p>or, The Rambles and Adventures of <span class="smcap">Bob Tallyho</span>, Esq., and his Cousin, the
Hon. <span class="smcap">Tom Dashall</span>, through the Metropolis. Exhibiting a Living Picture of
Fashionable Characters, Manners, Amusements in High and Low Life, by an
Amateur. Embellished and Illustrated with a Series of Coloured Prints,
Designed and Engraved by Messrs. Heath, Alkén, Dighton, Rowlandson, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As may be readily conceived, the stage soon claimed “Tom and Jerry.” The
first drama founded upon the work was from the pen of Mr. Barrymore, and
thus announced in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> bill:&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Royal Amphitheatre</span>. Extraordinary Novelty
and Eccentric Production. Monday, September 17, 1821, at half-past six
o’clock precisely, will be presented, never acted, an entirely New,
Whimsical, Local, Melo-Dramatic, Pantomimical Drama, with new scenery,
dresses, and mechanical changes, founded on Pierce Egan’s popular work,
which has lately engrossed the attention of all London, called ‘<span class="smcap">Life in
London</span>;’ or, Day and Night Scenes of Tom and Jerry, in their Rambles and
Sprees through the Metropolis.” The piece prepared for stage
representation by Mr. W. Barrymore.<a name='fna_30' id='fna_30' href='#f_30'><small>[30]</small></a></p>

<p>“Corinthian Tom, Mr. Gomersal; Jerry Hawthorn, Mr. Jones; and Bob Logic,
Mr. Herring.”</p>

<p>The second dramatic version was written for the Olympic Theatre, by
Charles Dibden, and thus set forth in the bill:&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Olympic Theatre</span>. On
Monday, November 12, 1821, and following evenings, will be presented a New
Extravaganza of Fun, founded on Pierce Egan’s highly popular work, and
interspersed with a variety of Airs and Graces, called “<span class="smcap">Life in London</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tom</span> (a Capital of the Corinthian Order) Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span> (out of Order, and more of the Composite than Corinthian,

<p>Mr. W. T. Moncrieff&mdash;one of the most successful and prolific writers of
the day&mdash;appeared as the third on the list of dramatists, and it was
announced at the Adelphi Theatre in the following style:&mdash;“On Monday, Nov.
26th, 1821, will be presented for the first time, on a scale of
unprecedented extent (having been many weeks in preparation, under the
superintendence of several of the most celebrated Artists, both in the
<i>Ups and Downs</i> of Life, who have all kindly come forward to assist the
Proprietors in their endeavours to render this Piece a complete
out-and-outer), an entirely new Classic, Comic, Operatic, Didactic,
Aristophanic, Localic, Analytic, Panoramic, Camera-Obscura-ic,
Extravaganza Burletta of Fun, Frolic, Fashion, and Flash, in three acts,
called ‘<span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; or, <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>.’ Replete with Prime Chaunts,
Rum Glees, and Kiddy Catches, founded on Pierce Egan’s well-known and
highly popular work of the same name, by a celebrated extravagant erratic
Author. The Music selected and modified by him, from the most eminent
composers, ancient and modern, and every Air furnished with an attendant
train of Graces. The costume and scenery superintended by Mr. I. R.
Cruikshank, from the Drawings by himself and his brother, Mr. George
Cruikshank, the celebrated Artists of the original work.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> TOM <i>and</i> JERRY, <i>as just arrived</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ya! hip! come along, Jerry; here we are safe arrived, my boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Welcome, my dear Jerry, to Corinthian Hall&mdash;to my snug chaffing
crib&mdash;where, I hope, we shall have many a rare bit of gig together.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Chaffing crib! I’m at fault, coz, can’t follow.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> My prattling parlour&mdash;my head quarters, coz&mdash;where I unbend with my
pals. You are now in London the bang-up spot of the world for fun, frolic,
and out-and-out-ing. Here it shall be my care, Jerry, to introduce you to
all sorts of life&mdash;from the flowers of society, the roses, pinks, and
tulips, of one court, to the mechanical tag-rag and
bobtail&mdash;vegetables&mdash;bunches of turnips&mdash;and strings of ing-ens, of
another: for without a proper introduction, London, gay, bustling,
various, as it is, would be no more than an immense wilderness.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> I suppose not. I’ll do as much for you another time.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> We must make the best use of our time; I have seen a great deal of
life myself; still I have a great deal yet to see. But let me give you a
caution or two before we set out; never be too confident&mdash;rather at all
times plead ignorance than show it; never disgrace the character of a
friend, in that family where you are introduced as a friend; let the
honour of the husband and the peace of the father be preserved inviolable;
and never have the once friendly door be shut against you, either as a
seducer&mdash;a hypocrite&mdash;or a scoundrel. But I say, my dear fellow, what do
you call all this?&mdash;this toggery of yours will never fit&mdash;you must have a
new rig-out.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Eh! oh! I understand. You think the cut of my clothes rather too
rustic&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Exactly; dress is the order of the day. A man must have the <i>look</i>
of a gentleman, if he has nothing else. We must assume a style if we have
it not. This, what do you call it?&mdash;this cover-me-decently, was all very
well at Hawthorn Hall, I dare say; but here, among the pinks in
Rotten-row, the ladybirds in the Saloon, the angelics at Almack’s,
the-top-of-the-tree heroes, the legs and levanters at Tattersall’s, nay,
even among the millers at the Fives, it would be taken for nothing less
than the index of a complete flat.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> I suppose not&mdash;what’s to be done?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I’ll tell you; before we start on our sprees and rambles, I’ll send
for that kiddy-artist, Dicky Primefit, the dandy habit maker, of
Regent-street. He shall rig you out in grand twig, in no time. Here,
Regular! (<i>Calls</i>).</p>

<p><i>Reg.</i> Here I am sir.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Send for Dicky Primefit, directly.</p>

<p><i>Reg.</i> What! the sufferer, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, that’s the fellow; tell him to bring his card of address with
him.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Sufferer! I’m at fault again, Tom; can’t follow.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> The tailor, Jerry: we do make them suffer sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Reg.</i> Yes, sir, the tailor bless me, how very uneducated; I thought every
gentleman knew his tailor was the sufferer; I’m sure I know mine is, and
to some tune too, I’ll chivey the rascal here directly, sir.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> A swell! I’m at fault again.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A swell, my dear Jerry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> (<i>Speaks without</i>). Just arrived, eh, very well. I’ll go up!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But stay; here comes my friend Bob Logic; he shall tell you what a
swell is&mdash;his head contains all the learning&mdash;I beg his pardon&mdash;all the
larks extant; he is a complete walking map of the metropolis&mdash;a perfect
pocket dictionary of all the flash cant, and slang patter, either of St.
James’s or St. Giles’s; only twig him. Welcome, my dear Bob; ten thousand
welcomes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img15.jpg" alt="Mr. ROBERT LOGIC. Albany." /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> LOGIC.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Thankye, my dear Tom&mdash;thankye. Seeing your natty gig and fast
trotter at the door, as I passed, I couldn’t avoid popping in to welcome
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> back to town. You’ve been sadly miss’d among the big ones since
you’ve been away. Lots of chaffing about you at Daffy’s.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I suppose so. You couldn’t have popped in more opportunely! Allow
me to introduce to you my companion and cousin, Jeremiah Hawthorn,
Esquire, from Somersetshire; Jerry Hawthorn, Doctor Logic, commonly called
Bob Logic&mdash;Doctor Logic, Jerry Hawthorn. Bob is the most finished man of
all the pavé, Jerry, whether for drinking, roving, getting in a row or
getting out of one.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Oh, you flatter me! I yield the palm to you in those particulars.
To be sure I always was a knowing one.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You were, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> (<i>To Jerry</i>). Your most obedient, sir; happy to see you. Where did
you pick him up? (<i>To Tom</i>).</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A slip from the chawbacons; rescued him from yokels. The business
is this; bred up in Somersetshire. Jerry has never before crossed
Claverton Downs. He is now come to see life, and rub off a little of the
rust. In effecting this desirable consummation you can materially assist;
under so skilful a professor of the flash as you, Bob&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Flash! I’m at fault again, Tom.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Explain, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Flash, my young friend, or slang as others call it, is the
classical language of the Holy Land; in other words, St. Giles’s Greek.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> St. Giles’s Greek; that is a language, doctor, with which I am
totally unacquainted, although I was brought up at a Grammar School.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> You are not particular in that respect; many great scholars, and
better linguists than you, are quite as ignorant of it, it being studied
more in the Hammer Schools than the Grammar Schools. Flash, my young
friend, or slang, as others call it, is a species of cant in which the
knowing ones conceal their roguery from the flats; and it is one of the
advantages of seeing Life in London, that you may learn to talk to a rogue
in his own language, and fight him with his own weapons.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I was telling him before you came in, Bob, that he must go in
training for a swell, and he didn’t understand what I meant.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Oh, yes, I did, Tom.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No, no, you didn’t; come, confess your ignorance.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Not know what a swell meant?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No: he wasn’t up.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Not up?</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> That is, you were not down.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Not down!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No; you’re green!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><i>Jerry.</i> Green!</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Ah! not fly!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, not awake!</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> “Green! fly! awake!” D&mdash;me, but I’m at fault. I don’t understand
one word you are saying.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> We know you don’t, and that’s what we’re telling you. Poor young
man&mdash;very uninformed.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Quite ignorant, isn’t he, Bob?</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Melancholy to think of&mdash;quite lamentable.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You must go to school, again, Jerry.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> What! the Hammer School?</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Yes, take your degrees under the classical Captain Grose. A swell,
my dear boy, or rather an empty swell, is an animal very plentiful in the
fashionable world; which, like the frog in the fable, wishing to appear
greater than it is, and vie with the substantial John Bulls of the
Exchange, keeps puffing and puffing itself out, till it bursts in the
attempt, and proves its appearance, like itself, a bubble.</p>

something of this cut. (<i>Turning round and showing himself</i>).</p>

God,&mdash;only get into Tip Street, Jerry.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, come let’s make a start of it&mdash;where shall we go? No matter.
I commit him to your care, Bob&mdash;use him well, remember he is not out of
pupil’s straits, and musn’t be blown up at point nonplus yet.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Why on London points I confess I am miserably ignorant. But for
anything in the country, now&mdash;such as leaping a five-barred gate, jumping
a ditch, trotting my pony against anything alive, wrestling, cudgelling,
or kissing in the ring, depend on it, Tom, you’ll find me&mdash;fly.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> He’s a fine-spirited youth, and will soon make a tie of it with
us&mdash;we’ll start first to the show shop of the metropolis, Hyde
Park!&mdash;promenade it down the grand strut, take a ride with the pinks in
Rotten Row, where dukes and dealers in queer&mdash;heavy plodders and
operators&mdash;noblemen, and yokels&mdash;barber’s clerks, costard-mongers&mdash;swell
coves, and rainbows, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> jostle one another; then we’ll have a stroll
through Burlington Arcade, peep in at Tattersal’s, and finish as fancy
leads us.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Bravo! Hyde Park! Burlington Arcade! nothing can be better.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> No; Arcades are all the go now.</p>

wants to sell&mdash;you can’t have a better, Sir; here, you Bob, bring him out.
There’s action for you&mdash;there’s one to tip ’em the go-bye at a
mill,&mdash;there’s earth-stoppers&mdash;quiet to drive, quiet in harness, trots
fifteen miles in less than an hour. Warranted sound&mdash;he would be cheap at
a hundred, and I shouldn’t wonder if he was to go for thirty.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Ah, thirty-pence&mdash;two-and-six-pence,&mdash;I wouldn’t have him at a
gift.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> He may be a good one to go&mdash;but he’s a rum one to look at&mdash;one of

<p><i>Gul.</i> Here’s a customer, by jingo. It’s booked. Mr. Green’s the

honour, do you, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> No thank’ye, I’m not going to trust an hanimal like that with
nobody but myself. Can nobody have the goodness to lend me a bit of rope,
to get him along vith?</p>

<p><i>Cope.</i> No we’ve got you in a line, and that’s quite enough. (<i>Aside</i>) You
bought him too cheap, to have rope with him, Sir; but here’s a hay-band,
that will do perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> An ay-band&mdash;oh, ah; an ay-band will do very well,&mdash;do you think I
can get him as far as Tooley Street, vith this?</p>

<p><i>Cope.</i> Oh, yes, Sir, he’s as quiet as a lamb, and a famous hunter.</p>

I’ve bought an unter!</p>

selling; and while the dealers are running down the cattle, we can get a

London! and see what game Cupid has sprung up for us in that quarter.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Aye; call a rattler.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> A rattler! I’m at fault again.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> A rattler is a rumbler, otherwise a jarvey! better known perhaps by
the name of a hack; handy enough in wet weather, or a hurry.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> A hack! If it is the thing we rattled over the stones in to-day,
it might more properly be called a bone-setter.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Or bone-breaker&mdash;But if you dislike going in a hack, we’ll get you
a mab.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> A mab! I’m at fault again&mdash;never shall get properly broken in.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A mab is a jingling jarvey!&mdash;a cabriolet Jerry&mdash;but we must mind
our flash doesn’t peep out at Almack’s. ’Tis classic ground there; the
rallying spot of all the rank, wealth, and beauty in the metropolis; the
very atmosphere of it is&mdash;</p>

there is no Mrs. Green&mdash;I am not an ’appy man yet! There are no little

been taken in by the purchase of an ’orse at Tattersall’s&mdash;It was a very

for flattery and deceit.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Nay, I am sincere, by heaven!</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Oh, who has not heard of our gallant black diamond,</i></span><br />
<i>Who once down at Hungerford us’d for to ply?</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>His mawleys he us’d with such skill and dexterity,</i></span><br />
<i>Winning each mill, and making each miller fly!</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>He fibb’d so neat&mdash;he stopped so steadily;</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>He’s Champion of England, and now fills the chair.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cribb.</i> Thank’ye, gentleman, thank’ye&mdash;but as I see by our sporting
oracle, “The Dispatch,” there’s a mill on foot&mdash;I’ll give you, “<i>May the
best man win</i>.”</p>

<p>(<i>All drink</i>). May the best man win.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> May the best man vin.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> With all my heart; but, zounds! we’ve almost buzz’d the bowl. Let’s
have another, and dy’e hear, Tom, serve it up in your prize cup; Jerry
hasn’t seen it, and we mustn’t omit that.</p>

<p><i>Cribb.</i> With all my heart, Doctor; but you must stand a bottle to see the
cup.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Aye, aye; I’ll stand a bottle, Tom.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ditto for me.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Yes, and I’ll stand a bottle of ditto, too.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> This may, indeed, be called the very Temple of the Fancy.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> Yes, and here are some of the finest fancy sketches in the kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, Jerry, after our last night’s divertisement at Almack’s, the
set-to I gave you this morning at the great Commissary-General Jackson’s
rooms cannot be better followed up than by a turn in the sporting parlour
of honest Tom Cribb.</p>

<p><i>Cribb.</i> Thank’ye, Mr. Corinthian; I’ll always do my best to satisfy you
in any way.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> There is one way, Tom, in which you would very soon satisfy us.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Yes, and I’m thinking not a little to our dis-satisfaction. I am
of opinion that every gentleman should practice the art of self defence,
if it were only to protect him from the insults of vulgar ignorance;
though I by no means set myself up as a champion for boxing.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> No, for if you did we’ve a champion here who would set you down.
We’ll drink his health, and may he ever prove as successful as when he
floor’d the Black Miller at Thistleton Gap. (<i>All drink</i>).</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Tom, your health. (<i>Cribb rises</i>). Silence for Tom’s speech&mdash;doff
your castor, Tom&mdash;that’s the time of day.</p>

<p><i>Cribb.</i> Gentlemen, my humble duty to you. Here’s all your healths, and
your families. Bless your soul, I can claim no merit for what I’ve done;
fighting came naturally like, and thinking others might be as fond of it
as myself, why, I always gave them a bellyfull.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Bravo, Tom, an excellent speech&mdash;Cicero never spoke better.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> No, nor anything like it.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, here comes the cup. Look out, Jerry.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>Such a knowing, &amp;c.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>At school I play’d the truant,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And would robbing orchards go;</i></span><br />
<i>I burned my master’s cane and rod,</i><br />

danced with a Almack’s&mdash;could they be the incognitas that challenged us
thither? There is some secret charm about those girls that hasn’t allowed
me to rest all night.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Well, and do you know, Tom, to tell you the truth, I haven’t been
a whit better than yourself. But, I say, only see how confoundedly the
dustman’s getting hold of Logic,&mdash;we’ll funk him. (<i>Tom and Jerry smoke

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> (<i>aside to Tom</i>). Be quiet&mdash;I’ll soon turn the tables.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Plaise your honour, I have brought before your worship a most
notorious substitute and common street talker, who, for her foul doings,
has been cooped up in the Poultry Compter, as often as there are years in
a week.&mdash;I caught her charging these honest gentlemen, (<i>pointing to Tom
and Jerry</i>) in a most impositious manner, and when I civilly axed her, how
she could think of getting drunk, and acting so, she called her bullies
here. (<i>Pointing to Kate and Sue</i>).</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Zounds, fellow, you don’t mean us?</p>

<p><i>Sue.</i> Why, you rascal, I’ll twist your neck for you.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Yes; they, your worship, who half murdered me first, and then
buried poor little Teddy O’Boozle in his box, that he mightn’t prevent
them murdering t’other half of me; och, they’re terrible desperadoes!</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Here’s a scoundrel for you!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Silence! we’ll soon get to the bottom of all this.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Zounds, sirrah, we gave the charge ourselves. (<i>To M’Lush</i>).</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Och, murder!</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Those were the assailants. (<i>Pointing to Tom, Jerry, and Logic</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> This is a very intricate affair.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Sure, won’t I be after telling you my own story:&mdash;as I was going my
rounds quietly enough, up comes these young sparks, and gave me such a
maulagaran, that they knock’d me into the middle of next week&mdash;besides
tipping me this here black eye&mdash;only see how red it is!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I’ll soon set all to rights,&mdash;first let me hear what you have to
say to all this, woman: these are very serious allegations. (<i>To Mrs.
Tartar</i>).</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Aye, aye, let the woman speak.</p>

<p><i>O’Booz.</i> Oh, the woman will speak fast enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Hold your tongue fellow.&mdash;Please your worship, it’s all false
from beginning to end&mdash;it’s he that’s drunk! nay, you may perceive he’s so
drunk he cannot even give a charge&mdash;doesn’t know one person from the
other, and can scarcely stand.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Plaise your honour it’s only the ague, I have it every Saturday
night regularly, what I’ve said is all true, so help me Bob,&mdash;sure, she’s
not a woman to put whiskey in a jug, and throw stones at it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Why, you impudent vagabond you’re drunk now&mdash;instead of giving
charge of her, the good lady ought to have given charge of you,&mdash;what
business had you off your beat, and in such a situation?</p>

<p><i>Tom and Jerry.</i> Aye, what business had you off your beat, old Charley?</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> They bate me off my beat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><i>Mrs. T.</i> I give charge of him, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> And I take it&mdash;off with him to the black hole.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Aye, aye, take him up the spout.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> My dear wife! (<i>Embraces Mrs. Tartar</i>). My dear Sally Tartar.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> His wife! Och, by the powers, then I’ve caught a Tartar.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Take him away.</p>

<p><i>M’L.</i> Och, sure I’m the boy that cares for nobody&mdash;so there’s my coat,
there’s my hat, there’s my rattle and lanthorn,&mdash;and to the devil I pitch
the whole of you. (<i>He is carried off</i>).</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> They musn’t get off so easily. (<i>Aside</i>).</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A fortunate turn-up for us, faith.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Gentlemen, you are at liberty.</p>

<p><i>O’Booz.</i> Stay, your honour, I’ve got a charge. This here chap (<i>pointing
to Tom</i>) with the Roosian head of hair&mdash;he comes up to me like a warment&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, you impudent&mdash;(<i>Knocks O’Boozle down&mdash;a row ensues</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Silence! silence!&mdash;be quiet all of you, can’t you?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Mr. Constable, I have a charge&mdash;(<i>to O’Boozle</i>). Watchman, there’s
a crown&mdash;what I say, swear to. (<i>Aside</i>).</p>

<p><i>O’Booz.</i> I’ll swear to anything, your honour.</p>

<p><i>Log.</i> What the devil’s in the wind now?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> I charge those gentlemen with assaulting this young
woman&mdash;(<i>pointing to Jane</i>)&mdash;the watchman saw the whole transaction.</p>

<p><i>O’Booz.</i> I’ll swear it, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, zounds, fellow, I never saw the girl!</p>

<p><i>Sue.</i> (<i>To Jerry</i>). Come, sir, you can’t say you never saw her.</p>

<p><i>Jerry.</i> Why I have a recollection of seeing her somewhere, though I am at

<p><i>Kate.</i> It’s a clear case.</p>

difficulties which, unless timely met, must terminate in ruin. I have
bought up most of his debts; and in the midst of the gaiety of this
evening, it is my intention to have him arrested and conveyed to prison. I
have sent the officer my card of invitation, that he may be sure to gain
admittance. This will open the eyes of the thoughtless trio, and enable us
to put the money we took in trust at the gambling-house to its proper use;
so let’s away, and about it straight.</p>

ninety-three nights in succession; and its <i>golden</i> career only stopped by

piece by Mr. W. T. Moncrieff&mdash;went with Walbourn, the great Dusty Bob, and
Cooper, who played to the life, Little Jemmy, the cripple, to Sadler’s

1822. Keeley was threatened by the Adelphi lessees&mdash;Messrs. Rodwell and
Jones&mdash;with an action for breach of engagement, but the action was never
brought. In the season of 1822-3 at the Adelphi, John Reeve&mdash;‘<i>Glorious
John!</i>’ became Jerry Hawthorn, Mr. Brown took the part of Jemmy Green, and
several other changes in the original cast were effected. At Christmas,
1822, <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was compressed so as to admit of the production of a

<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>“It is scarcely necessary to observe this Drama is founded on the
“<span class="smcap">Life in London</span>” of my friends <span class="smcap">Pierce Egan</span>, and the inimitable
<span class="smcap">Cruickshank</span>. Aided by <span class="smcap">Pierce’s</span> clever illustrations to the matchless
series of plates to that work, I have in this piece, endeavoured to
put them into dramatic motion; running a connecting story through the
whole, making such modifications and amplifications, and furnishing
such reflections and results, as I deemed necessary. From the
popularity of the subject, the novelty and acknowledged truth of the
various scenes comprised in it, and the beauty of the music I
fortunately selected, this Piece obtained a popularity, and excited a
sensation, totally unprecedented in Theatrical History; from the
highest to the lowest, all classes were alike anxious to witness its
representation; Dukes and Dustmen were equally interested in its
performance, and Peers might be seen mobbing it with Apprentices to
obtain admission. Seats were sold for weeks before they could be
occupied, every Theatre in the United Kingdom, even in the United
States, enriched its coffers by performing it; and the smallest
tithe-portion of its profits, would for ever have rendered it
unnecessary for its Author to have troubled the public with any
further productions of his Muse. It established the fortunes of most
of the Actors engaged in its representation, and gave birth to many
publications and several newspapers. The success of the “<span class="smcap">Beggar’s
Opera</span>,” the “<span class="smcap">Castle Spectre</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">Pizarro</span>,” sunk into the shade
before it. In the <i>furore</i> of its popularity, persons have been known
to travel post from the furthest parts of the Kingdom to see it; and
five guineas have been offered for a single seat.&mdash;These facts are not
recapitulated here from any feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> egotism&mdash;the success of this
Drama, was the temporary rage of the moment, from time-serving
circumstances, and was never regarded in any other light by its
Author; they are merely noticed as curious events in theatrical
history.&mdash;With respect to the cry of immorality, so loudly raised by
those inimical to the success and plain-speaking of this piece, it is
soon answered! To say nothing of the envy of rival Theatres feeling
its attraction most sensibly in their Saturday Treasuries, those
notorious pests the Watchmen; dexterously joined in the war-howl of
detraction raised against it, and by converting every trifling
street-broil into a “<i>Tom and Jerry row</i>,” endeavoured to revenge
themselves for the <i>exposè</i> its scenes afforded of their villany and
extortion; but all in vain. In vain, too, it was the Actor’s old
rivals, the <i>Methodists</i>, took the alarm&mdash;in vain they distributed the
whole of the stock of the <i>Religious Tract Society</i> at the doors of
the Theatre&mdash;in vain they denounced “<i>Tom and Jerry</i>” from the
pulpit&mdash;in vain the puritanical portion of the Press prated of its
immorality&mdash;in vain the prejudices of the stiff-backed part of the
Bench&mdash;the hypocritical host of Saints cried it down, and preached woe
and destruction to those who supported it.&mdash;They but increased the
number of its followers, and added to its popularity. Vainly, too, was
the Lord Chamberlain called upon to suppress it&mdash;His Grace came one
night to see it, and brought his Duchess the next. It was nearly the
same with the Chief Magistrate of Bow Street: his experience rendered
him perfectly sensible, that, long before the appearance of “<i>Tom and
Jerry</i>,” young men and country gentlemen would in moments of hilarity,
sometimes exceed in their potations, be provoked into quarrels by
designing Watchmen, and consigned, for purposes of extortion on the
following morning, to His Honour, the Night Constable; but according
to the Saints’ accounts, to believe their tales, it must be held as a
point of faith, that no one, previous to the appearance of “<i>Tom and
Jerry</i>,” ever got into a row!&mdash;Oh, no&mdash;drinking and all its train of
follies were unknown to youth, until inculcated into their minds by
the example of “<i>Tom and Jerry</i>!” How many an unsuspecting <i>Country
Cousin</i> has been converted, in the public newspapers, through an hour
of harmless frolic, into a <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; while his equally unconscious Town
relation figured as a <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> honest plodder they may have had
with them is transformed into a <span class="smcap">Bob Logic</span>&mdash;his first appearance in
that character. The thing speaks for itself: the hue and cry of the
immorality and danger of this piece was raised merely for the purposes
of plunder, by Watchmen and others. So far from being immoral, if the
piece be fairly examined, it will be found to be as correct in its
tendency as any production ever brought on the stage. The obnoxious
scenes of life are only shown that they may be avoided: the danger of
mixing in them is strikingly exemplified; and every incident tends to
prove, that happiness is only to be found in the domestic circle.</p>

<p>“It has been said, that many of the scenes of this piece should not
have been exhibited, being scenes of dissipation, riot, and
impropriety&mdash;ridiculous!&mdash;Has not Shakespeare asserted that the proper
use of the drama is&mdash;“to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature, to
show virtue her own feature, and vice her own image, and the very age
and body of the time its form and pressure:” could any piece do this
more effectually than “<i>Tom and Jerry</i>?” take away the scenes
complained of, it ceases to show the form and pressure of the age and
time.</p>

<p>“I should not have published this piece had not its success produced
such a host of imitations and plagiarisms, that more to prevent myself
suffering from the demerits of others than to avail myself of any
merits of my own. I give it with all its imperfections on its head, to
the world; willing to pay <i>smart blunt</i> for my own misdeeds, but not
<i>stand Sammy</i> for those of others. To those venerable noodles who
complain that I and my prototype, <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>, have made this the age of
flash; I answer any age is better than <i>The age of cant</i>! I tell my
pious lecturers, in plain terms, I shall always feel pleasure in
reflecting that I have in this piece, <i>nosed</i> every <i>move</i> on the
<i>board</i>, in the <i>game</i> of the <i>spell</i>; opened the <i>ogles</i> of the
<i>green</i> and the <i>yokel</i>, and the <i>muff</i>, and the <i>raw</i>; struck a light
on the <i>darky</i> of their <i>knowledge boxes</i>, <i>flashed</i> the <i>gab</i> of the
<i>prig</i>, the <i>leg</i>, the <i>scamp</i> and the <i>stringer</i>, in their
<i>listeners</i>, put them <i>fly</i> and <i>awake</i> to all they should be <i>up</i> and
<i>down</i> to, and enabled them, if their <i>lugs</i> are at all <i>wing</i> to the
<i>bits</i> of <i>good truth</i>, <i>pattered</i> to them in every scene of this
piece, <i>bank</i> their <i>rag</i>, <i>chivey</i> their <i>nurses</i>, <i>nash</i> their
<i>leading strings</i>, and keep out of the way of the <i>cut-along-coaches</i>
as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> travel the high <i>toby</i> of existence; and having so done, can
lay my <i>mawley</i> on my <i>core</i>, and conscienciously <i>chaunt</i> my
conviction, in which my <i>reader</i> will bear me out, “that I’ve cut all
the <i>buzmen</i>, and <i>done</i> the <i>thing right</i>.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pierce Egan on Mr. Walbourn’s “Dusty Bob.”</span></p>

<div class="note"><p>“It is the greatest possible praise to be praised by a man who is
himself deserving of praise.”</p>

<p>“Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed.”</p></div>


<p>Mr. Walbourn’s theatrical fame was made by, and, strange to say, expired
with the character of Dusty Bob. Pierce Egan, in his “Life of an
Actor,”&mdash;which he dedicated to Edmund Kean&mdash;classes his performance of
this part, as giving him a title in the niche of fame beside John Kemble,
Mrs. Siddons, and all the great actors contained in his “Catalogues of
Parts Acted”&mdash;which can never be forgotten by those who witnessed them.
Here is the note, and will be found at page twelve of the work:&mdash;“The
personification of Dusty Bob, by the above actor, has been unanimously
decided by the public to be one of the greatest triumphs of the histrionic
art ever exhibited on any stage. The first tragedian of the day,<a name='fna_35' id='fna_35' href='#f_35'><small>[35]</small></a> with
the utmost liberality, gave it as his opinion, that, during the whole
course of his theatrical life, he had never seen any performance equal to
it. Also, a comic actor of the greatest celebrity<a name='fna_36' id='fna_36' href='#f_36'><small>[36]</small></a> exclaimed, ‘Good
heaven! is it possible? Do my eyes deceive me? Most certainly it is a real
<i>dustman</i> they have got upon the stage. I am very sorry the profession has
descended so low as to be compelled to resort to the streets to procure a
person of that description to sustain the character.’ He left the body of
the theatre in utter disgust&mdash;nor was it until introduced to Mr. Walbourn
in person, behind the scenes, that he would believe it was an actor.
<i>Further praise than this is superfluous.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Mr. Walbourn as “Dusty Bob,” was drawn and engraved by George Cruikshank,
and sold, with other character-portraits, at the Adelphi Theatre. During
the long run of the piece, he exchanged one species of <i>hops</i> for another,
as he gave up his business as a private and stage dancing-master, and took
the “Maidenhead” public-house at Battle Bridge. The house, previous to his
taking it was doing only a small trade; but, when he became the landlord,
and put out a spick-span new and a “not so dusty” sign of himself as
“<span class="smcap">Dusty Bob</span>,” painted in oil by George Cruikshank, it drew together many of
the “Dusty” fraternity&mdash;and their doxies. After that, “Dusty Bob,”
together with “Black Sal,” became to be bye words, as, near to the house,
was Smith’s dust-yard, at which hundreds were employed, male and female.

<p>Besides the authors already mentioned. Tom Dibden, Farrell, and Douglas
Jerrold, each produced dramas upon the popular theme; and during the
seasons of 1821-2, “Life in London” was performed with great <i>éclat</i>, at
ten theatres in and around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> metropolis, to overflowing houses. But
Pierce Egan at length became tired of the successes of the playwrights in
using his book, and resolved to try his own hand at a dramatic
version&mdash;or, as he termed it, “to take a leaf or two out of his own
book”&mdash;and the <span class="smcap">Author’s Piece</span> was “got up” and performed for the first
time at Sadler’s Wells, under the respectable management of Mr. Egerton,
on Monday, April 8, 1822, with most decided success.</p>

<p>It was thus announced by Mrs. Egerton, in the address written for the
occasion by T. Greenwood, Esq.</p>

<p class="poem">“To-night, my friends, this modern taste to meet,<br />

<p>Brighton, of course, in common with all other large provincial towns had
its version of “Life in London.” The theatre was then under the management
of Mr. Samuel&mdash;or, as he was commonly known, Jerry Sneak Russell, from the
inimitable manner in which he personated that character in Foote’s farce
of “The Mayor of Garrat.” We have a copy of the play-bill before us, and
as we think the manager’s remarks and the selection of criticisms are in
their way curious, we here append them, including the cast of characters:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">THEATRE ROYAL, BRIGHTON.</span><br />
<small>LAST NIGHT BUT ONE.</small><br />
<span class="large">TOM AND JERRY.</span></p>

<p>In announcing the successful piece of “Tom and Jerry” for this evening,
the manager feels great satisfaction in being able to quote in its favour
the following observations from the critiques in the London and other
newspapers. “The scenery, dresses, &amp;c., are good throughout, and much
credit is due to the manager for the style in which it is got up. It is
with pleasure we remark that this piece has been most judiciously freed
from the impurities of dialogue, which rendered it improper to meet the
delicate ear of the gentler sex. We therefore venture, without subjecting
ourselves to reproach, to recommend our readers to see ‘Life in London,’
to witness an exposure of many impositions practised in real life, and be
made ‘fly’ (the plain English of <i>au fait</i>) to the <i>multum in parvo</i>
phrases which are now introduced into passing conversations.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brighton.</span>&mdash;The theatre at this place has just produced its ‘Tom and
Jerry’ with great success, and, we may say, deservedly&mdash;every
objectionable point that might be thought to infringe on decorum having
been most ingeniously suppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> without any diminution of the whim and
fire of its varied and entertaining scenes. This regard to propriety
argues much discretion, and seems to meet the approbation of the <i>beau
monde</i> resorting hither, for the theatre is graced with abundance of
fashion and beauty.”</p>

<p>“The ‘Tom and Jerry’ of the Brighton Theatre has good scenery, good
acting, and, what in such a piece is perhaps still better, good and chaste
dialogue to recommend it; it has been cleansed of its impurities without
injuring its life and spirit. As thus represented, it cannot raise a blush
on the cheek of the most fastidious female.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday Evening, September 12, 1822, will be reproduced the highly
popular and amusing Burletta of</p>

<p>The notoriety which Tom and Jerry obtained in England, became the topic of
conversation amongst our Gallic neighbours&mdash;nay, it crept so much into
favour with the gay folks of Paris, <span class="smcap">Life in London</span> was speedily translated
into French, under the title of “The Diorama; or, Picturesque Rambles in
London&mdash;containing the most faithful <i>Notices of the Character, Manners,
and Customs of the English Nation</i>, in the various classes of Society. By
M. S&mdash;&mdash;.” The translation had a most extensive circulation in France.</p>

<p>The reception of Tom and Jerry was equally flattering&mdash;notwithstanding the
great prejudices that had previously existed against it&mdash;in Dublin. Mr.
Wrench, from the Adelphi Theatre, was specially engaged to play the part
of Corinthian Tom. The first seven nights produced £1300; and the house,
on Mr. Wrench’s benefit night, held £345.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>The great success of “Life in London,” in its dramatic form in the Irish
capital lead up to the publication of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">“<span class="smcap">Real Life in Ireland</span>; or, the Day and Night Scenes, Rovings, Rambles,
and Sprees, Bulls, Blunders, Bodderation, and Blarney of Brian Born,
Esq., and his elegant friend <i>Sir Shawn O’Dogherty</i>. 1829. Coloured plates.”</p>

<p>In which the pictorial style of the Brothers Cruikshank was imitated from
an Hibernian point of view and colouring.</p>

<p>At both the Theatres in Edinburgh, Tom and Jerry attracted crowded
audiences, according to the Editor of the <i>Edinburgh Dramatic Review</i>, who
states thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At length the public of Edinburgh had opportunity of judging of the
merits of the above celebrated Extravaganza. From the general tendency of
the remarks which appeared in the newspapers, we were led to suppose that
this piece consisted of indecency and gross vulgarity. From what we heard
reported as to the numerous indelicacies which this sketch of Fun, Frolic,
Fashion, and Flash contained, we were afraid that its success with our
sober citizens would have been precarious; but, we are happy to say, that
the applause which was bestowed on it by the unprecedentedly numerous
assemblage on Saturday evening, January 25, 1823, which crowded the
Caledonian Theatre, is a sufficient answer to the chimerical doubts which
were industriously circulated against its propriety. There is nothing, as
we before remarked, associated with disgust or offence. There is neither
one word, action, or situation, in the whole course of the piece, that can
possibly raise a blush, or offend the most fastidious moralist!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>The Burletta of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>
and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> had been repeated so often all over the
kingdom, and particularly in the metropolis, that the performers,
notwithstanding the great applause they nightly received in the above
piece, absolutely became tired and worn-out with the repetition of their
characters, when the following piece of satire, written by T. Greenwood,
Esq., was published, entitled, “The Tears of Pierce Egan, Esq., for the
Death of ‘Life in London’; or, The Funeral of Tom and Jerry. Dedicated to
Robert and George Cruikshank, Esqs. Price Two Shillings, with an engraving
by George Cruikshank.”</p>

<p class="poem">“Beat out of the Pit, and thrown over the Ropes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> resign’d their last breath,</span><br />

<br />
“Odd and various reports of the cause are about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the real one was <i>this</i> I opine:</span><br />
They were run to a <i>standstill</i>, and, therefore, no doubt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the cause was a rapid <i>decline</i>.</span><br />
<br />
“When death showed his <i>Nob</i>, out of <i>Time</i> they were beat,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell to all nocturnal parleys:</span><br />
The Town felt regret, as the bell tolled the news,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one rejoiced&mdash;but the <i>Charleys</i>!</span><br />
<br />
“A monument, too, their kind Patrons will raise,<br />

<br />
“May their souls rest in peace, since they’ve chosen to flit,<br />

<p>In reference to the above, Pierce Egan states that Jemmy Catnach, the
renowned Ballad-monger of the Seven Dials, in less than twelves hours
after the publication, produced a pirated edition for street sale, for
two-pence.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce Egan, in his “<i>Finish</i>,” states that he reckoned no less than
sixty-five separate publications, which he enumerates <i>in extenso</i>, all
derived from his own work, and adds, with his usual amount of large and
small <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> and <i>italics</i>&mdash;“We have been <i>pirated</i>, <span class="smcaplc">COPIED</span>, <i>traduced</i>;
but, unfortunately, not <span class="smcaplc">ENRICHED</span> by our indefatigable exertions; therefore
<span class="smcaplc">NOTORIETY</span> must satisfy us, instead of the smiles of FORTUNE. Our efforts
have given rise to numerous productions in the market of literature, yet
we can assert, with a degree of confidence hitherto unshaken, that none of
our <i>Imitators</i> have dared to think for themselves during the long period
of seven years, neither have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> they shown any originality upon the subject
of ‘<span class="smcap">Life in London</span>’; but who have left it&mdash;<i>disinterested</i> souls!&mdash;to the
Author and Artist to put a CLIMAX to the adventures of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Logic</span>.” The last remark is in reference to the publication of “<span class="smcap">Pierce
Egan’s Finish</span> to the Adventures of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, in their
Pursuits through <span class="smcap">Life in and Out of London</span>. With numerous coloured
illustrations by Robert Cruikshank. London: George Virtue &amp; Co., Ivy Lane,
Paternoster Row.” Seven years after the date of “The Life in London.” In
common with almost all other sequels, or “continuations” it was not
successful&mdash;the fact being that Pierce Egan, and the subject of his work
were alike literally and financially “used up!”</p>

<p>Old Jemmy Catnach, true to his line of life, soon joined what Pierce Egan
designates as the “Mob of Literary Pirates” who irritate the poor author
almost to madness, blast his prospects, impose on the unwary by their
imitations, and render his cash account all but nugatory, and, just as he
may be congratulating himself on the success of his genius, receiving the
smiles of Fame, and a <i>trifling sweetener</i> from Threadneedle Street, as a
reward for his exertions, he may be attacked by <i>Sappers</i> and
<i>Miners</i>&mdash;those pickers and stealers who do not absolutely come under the
denomination of <i>pickpockets</i>, yet <i>thieves</i> to all intents and purposes,
and, certainly, <i>robbers</i> of the most unprincipled description&mdash;a set of
vampires&mdash;living upon “the brains” of other persons, and who dare not to
think for themselves.</p>

<p>Catnach brought out a broadside, or “whole-sheet,” for street-sale,
entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img54tmb.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<a href="images/img54.jpg"><small>Larger Image</small></a></div>
<p class="center"><small><a href="#text99">Text of Image</a></small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>The “broadside,” which Pierce Egan calls&mdash;“Another wicked piracy, by
Catnach,” consists of twelve woodcuts,&mdash;of which we have given
<i>facsimiles</i> in our pages&mdash;it will be seen that they are reduced and very
roughly executed copies of the original plates by the Brothers Cruikshank,
but in reverse. Therefore the swaggering <span class="smcap">Notice to Pirates</span> which Jemmy
Catnach published reads funny enough. The letter-press matter consists of
flash songs, and a poetical epitome of the plot and design of the original
work of “Life in London.” And taking it as it stands, and from where it
emanated, rather a creditable performance, particularly when we take into
consideration&mdash;as duly announced by the street-patterer, that it
was&mdash;“Just printed and pub&mdash;lish&mdash;ed, all for the low charge of
“Twopence.”</p>

<p>On the rarity of this Catnachian and piratical edition of “Life in London”
it is superfluous to enlarge, and it is easy to account for this
circumstance, if we reflect that the broadside form of publication is by
no means calculated for preservation; hundreds of similar pieces printed
at the “Catnach Press” and at other offices publishing for street-sale
must have perished. The more generally acceptable a broadside or
street-ballad became, and was handed about for perusal, the more it was
exposed to the danger of destruction. No copy of Catnach’s version is
preserved in the British Museum, therefore, and for reason above stated,
it must be considered as a great “Literary Curiosity.”<a name='fna_38' id='fna_38' href='#f_38'><small>[38]</small></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we have before observed, “Life in London” was dedicated by permission
to George IV., and it is a circumstance in itself which looks singular
enough in this Victorian age, that royalty should have condescended to
have had such a work dedicated to it. One paragraph, which we are about to
quote, strikes us as being a very peculiar and free-and-easy style for an
author to address himself to a King of England. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Indeed, the whole chapter of ‘Life in London’ has been so repeatedly
perused by your Majesty in such a variety of shapes&mdash;from the elegant A,
the refined B, the polite C, the lively D, the eloquent E, the honest F,
the stately G, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> peep-o’-day H, the tasteful I, the manly J, the good
K, the noble L, the stylish M, the brave N, the liberal O, the proud P,
the long-headed Q, the animated R, the witty S, the flash T, the knowing
U, the honourable V, the consummate W, the funny X, the musical Y, and the
poetical Z,&mdash;that it would only be a waste of your Majesty’s valuable time
to expatiate further upon this subject.”</p>

<p>One notable effect of “Life in London,” particularly in its dramatised
form, must be recorded. It broke the heart of poor Billy Waters, the
one-legged musical negro, who died in St. Giles’s workhouse, on Friday,
March 21, 1823, whispering with his ebbing breath, a mild anathema, which
sounded very much like: “Cuss him, dam Tom&mdash;meē&mdash;Tom&mdash;meē Jerry!”</p>

<p>Poor Billy endeavoured, up to the period of his last illness, to obtain
for a wife and two children what he termed, “An honest living by scraping
de cat-gut!” by which he originally collected considerable sums of money
at the West-end of the town, where his ribbon-decked cocked hat and
feathers, with the grin on his countenance, and sudden turn and kick out
of his wooden limb, and other antics and efforts to please, excited much
mirth and attention, and were well rewarded from the pockets of John Bull.
The burden of Billy’s ditty “from morn to dewy eve,” and from January to
December, was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Polly will you marry me&mdash;Polly don’t you cry,<br />
Polly will you marry me&mdash;Polly don’t you cry:&mdash;<br />

<p class="center">BILLY WATERS.</p>

<p>Mr. W. T. Moncrieff, the dramatist, is responsible for the following
biographical notice of this old London Street Character:&mdash;“Of this
meritorious and lamented individual, we had with great trouble collected
from various sources, an ample and interesting Biography. But
unfortunately for posterity, in the same classic regions where he lost his
life, <i>we</i> also lost his life; and, to tell the truth under the influence
of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> seductive fluid too&mdash;<i>Daffy!</i>&mdash;we can therefore only present
our reader with a few brief notices from memory.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Billy Waters</span>, was born in the powerful African kingdom of <span class="smcap">Tongocongotaboo</span>,
where he was a native Prince, and bore the name of <span class="smcap">Pokikokiquanko</span>; from
this place he was at an early age, to the universal regret of his loving
subjects, kidnapped, by ‘an auld Quaker,’ who bought him from his
treacherous attendants, for two axes, a frying-pan and a bag of nails.
This <i>black</i> piece of business made him a slave, in the French settlement,
at Demarara, from whence however he speedly took <i>French leave</i>, and
entered, we believe, the British navy as a cook <i>par excellence</i> on board
the Ganymede sloop of war, under the command of Sir John Purvis, where,
during a fierce engagement, he lost a leg, some say gallantly fighting the
enemies of old England, though others insinuate it was through falling
down the cockpit ladder, in his great hurry to hide himself. His own
version was that he fell from the top-sail yard to the quarter deck during
a storm, we cannot pretend to decide which was the fact, it however
occasioned his being sent to England, as unfit for service. Arriving in
London, he betook himself to that wild mode of life, which best suited his
origin; the trammels of civilized society, had no charm for him; he
scorned the mechanical rules of man, and picked up his living wherever he
could find it. Born a Prince, and bearing a native princeliness in his
appearance it is not to be wondered at that his associates should speedly
elect him to the regal dignity of their tribe.</p>

<p>In the year 1812 Billy was solemnly inauguared <i>ex cathedra</i> into the
sovereignty of mendicityship&mdash;King of the Beggars&mdash;at the cellar of St.
Patrick in St Giles’, a rank he supported with great satisfaction and
majesty, till the luckless period when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> rival <i>Billy</i> (<span class="smcap">Bodkin</span>), by
being placed at the head of the mendicity society, virtually became King
of the Beggars in his own right. This&mdash;as he conceived it, cruel
usurpation by Bodkin, pricked Billy just a leetle too hard. From that
moment he drooped as a blighted <i>lily</i>, and like another black hero he
exclaimed&mdash;‘Othello’s occupation’s gone.’ The fickle British public
refused to be as liberal as they had been, which he attributed to the
production of “<i>Tom and Jerry</i>” with whom he was made to partake of:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Shoulder of veal and garnish&mdash;Turkey and appendages&mdash;Parmesan and
Filberts&mdash;Port and Madeira.” Billy on hearing the above list given out
as forming the “peck and booze for the evening,” exclaimed “Dat dam
goot, me like a de Madery&mdash;Landlord, here, you give this bag of broken
wittals, vot I had give to me to day, to some genteel dog vot pass
your door: and you make haste wid de supper, you curse devil you.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> LANDLORD <i>with Supper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Landlord.</i> Now, your honours, here’s the rum peck, here’s the supper.</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> Eh, de supper! de supper! come along. (<i>After striking</i>
<span class="smcap">Creeping Jack</span> <i>on the fingers with a knife</i>) you damn nasty dog! what
for you put yur dirty fingers in de gravy? you call dat gentlemans?
you want your fingers in de pie, now you got him dere!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> I only wish’d to taste the stuffining.</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> And now you taste de carver knife instead! (<i>Takes candle,
and looks at supper</i>). Vy, what him call dis?</p>

<p><i>Landlord.</i> Why the turkey and the pie, to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> De turkey and de pie! I tink you said de turkey and de
pie,&mdash;&mdash;what! de turkey widout de sassinger! him shock&mdash;&mdash;him wouldn’t
give pin for turkey widout dem&mdash;&mdash;me like a de Alderman in chain.</p>

<p><i>Landlord.</i> I’m very sorry, Mr. Waters, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> You sorry!&mdash;&mdash;I sorry for my supper, you damn dog, you serve
up de turkey without de sassinger&mdash;no lemon to de weal&mdash;no hoyster
saase to de rum’-steaks, who you tink eat rum’-steaks widout de
hoyster saase? You send no filberts to de Port, nor debils to de
Madery nather. Mee must use some other hot-hell&mdash;you dog.</p></div>

<p>However, by a combination of events, Billy became very poor, and was
obliged, prior to his going into the workhouse, to part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> with his old
friend, the fiddle.&mdash;“Him lend him ole fiddle to him uncle at de pop
shop,” and the wooden <i>pin</i> (leg) which had so often supported Billy,
would have shared the same fate, but its extensive service had rendered it
worthless though it had twice saved poor Billy from the penalties of the
<i>Treadmill</i>. At length, in the full belief that his spirit was about to
flee to meet his coloured ancestors in the realms of bliss and a free
hunting ground, he duly made his will, in which he bequeathed to W.
Bodkin, Esq,&mdash;<i>Billy Bodkin</i>, the Hon. Sec. to the Mendicity Society: a
bodkin that had so often pierced Billy to the heart&mdash;his wooden leg,
earnestly desiring he might receive it in his <i>latter end</i>.</p>

<p>In life he had been accustomed to wear a military cocked hat, a judge’s
full-bottomed cauliflower wig, and a naval officer’s jacket and trousers,
symbolical of his being the head and arbiter of the naval, military, and
judicial departments in his eleemosynary kingdom, these he bequeathed in
the following manner: His <i>wig</i> he left to the <span class="smcap">Court of Chancery</span>, in the
vague hope that they might obtain with it a little of his decision in
equity, and promptness in justice. His <i>military hat</i> he left to the <span class="smcap">Heads</span>
of the <span class="smcap">Horse Guards</span>, and his <i>naval jacket</i> and <i>trousers</i> to the <i>old
washerwomen</i> that manage the <span class="smcap">Greenwich Hospital</span>. The <span class="smcap">Deal Fiddle</span>, on which
he had been used to scrape his <i>native</i> <span class="smcaplc">WOOD</span> <i>notes wild</i>, we are happy to
state, was taken out of lavender, and is now in the possession of the
<span class="smcap">Tyburn</span> <i>Ketch</i> and Glee Club&mdash;the duplicate having been bequeathed to them
for that purpose.</p>

<p>In conclusion we have only to state, that Billy was an accomplished
cadger, a skilful musician, and adroit dancer&mdash;doing more on one leg than
many others on two, and possessed abilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> that as an actor would have
rendered him a <i>shining</i> ornament to the stage&mdash;“to hold, as t’were, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own black
<i>image</i>!”</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img57.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Billy was considered of sufficient public importance, when in the <i>flesh</i>,
to be moulded and well <i>baked</i> by a Potter, who taking up and moistening a
lump of clay, said, “<i>Be ware!</i>” and then turned Billy out in one of his
happiest moods and positions, with a broad grin on his black <i>mug</i>&mdash;a
perfect <i>image</i>, suitable for a chimney or sideboard ornament; which found
a ready sale at the time of its manufacture, but has now become very rare
in perfect condition, and, much coveted by collectors to add to their
Class, or Section of “<span class="smcap">English Characters</span>.” Specimens of this style of ware
are exhibited in the Bethnal Green Museum, London. Henry Willett, Esq. of
Brighton, also exhibits his fine collection of the same class of ware at
the Brighton Free Public Library.</p>

<span class="smcap">Little Jemmy.</span></p>

<p>The real name of this notorious street-character was Andrew Whiston. He
was a born cripple, and in every respect a most miserable object of
charity. Moncrieff imported him into his Adelphi version of “Tom and
Jerry; or, Life in London,” as “Little Jemmy,” and there figures in the
<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Back Slums in the Holy Land</i>: in company with Mr. Jenkins, Soldier
Suke, Dingy Bet, Creeping Jack, Billy Waters, Ragged Dick, and other
well-known characters.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> page 46.</p>

<p>For many years Andrew, <i>alias</i> “Little Jemmy,” had been in the habit of
propelling himself about the streets of London in a little truck, or box
on wheels, assisted by the aid of two small crutches. He always wore a
white apron to conceal the deformity of his legs, which were curved, and
had the appearance of thin planks, having no calves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>To avoid the penalties attached to begging and vagrancy he usually carried
a few quill pens stuck in his coat and apron; declaring it to be the only
trade to which he had been brought up, whence he was called <i>The
Penmaker</i>! He has been heard to acknowledge he derived as much in his
perambulations through the streets as amounted to £2 per week. It was his
custom every morning to cross over Blackfriars Bridge for the purpose of
gathering alms. He always prided himself as <i>leader</i> of the “<i>Cadgers</i>,”
in the metropolis, and was one of the most dissipated of the class to
which he belonged; never returning to the hovel, in which he took up his
abode, in the Borough, except in a state of intoxication. In his fits of
inebriety, when at a distance from home, and incapable of proceeding, he
was generally picked up by some of the numerous coalheavers, residing in
the same quarter of the town, and carried to his dwelling on their
shoulders; this, from his diminutive stature, was no very difficult task
to perform.</p>

<p>On the night of his death, which occurred Monday, April 3, 1826, he had
been drinking spirits, and porter, during the day, and was as usual
carried home by two men; for which they were to receive a pot of beer. On
setting down their burden, the unfortunate man&mdash;who had been conveyed with
his head downwards, was discovered to be in a dying state. Surgical
assistance was immediately procured, but poor “<i>Little Jemmy</i>,” was quite
dead ere it arrived. Information of his death was given at 11 o’clock to
the night constable of St. Saviour’s Parish, who proceeded to the house,
the inmates of which refused to give up the body, on the ground that their
late lodger died in their debt a month’s rent. Another strong reason for
their refusal in delivering up the corpse, was a report that prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> in
the neighbourhood, that the surgeons of both the hospitals in the Borough
had offered no less a sum than £100 for the body after death, for the
purpose of dissection, in consequence of its extraordinary formation. The
constable, however, claimed the body of the deceased, as none of his
relations were on the spot, and conveyed it away to the watch-house,
clearly perceiving that if it was left behind, the inmates would dispose
of it to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>On Friday, April 7, an inquest was held at the Rose and Ball public-house,
Bankside, Southwark, before R. Carter, Esq. Upon the return of the jury
after viewing the body, all of whom expressed their astonishment at the
decrepitude and peculiar formation of the singular little man. The surgeon
in attendance having described the death to have occurred in consequence
of apoplexy. The jury brought in a verdict in accordance with the medical
evidence that the deceased died of “<span class="smcap">Apoplexy</span>.”</p>

<p>The day after the inquest sat on the body it was conveyed to St. Saviour’s
Burial ground, and interred in a grave dug 14 feet in depth from the
surface, over which were placed three other coffins, in order to secure it
against the resurrection-men, who were anxious to have the corpse to
dispose of.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the death of <span class="smcap">Billy Waters</span>, the notorious black mendicant
fiddler&mdash;March, 1823; “<span class="smcap">Little Jemmy</span>” acquired the soubriquet of The King
of the Beggars.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><b>The Tread-Mill at Brixton.</b></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img59.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>In the year 1817, Mr.&mdash;afterwards Sir William&mdash;Cubitt, of Ipswich, erected
a Tread-Mill at Brixton Gaol&mdash;and soon afterwards in other large prisons,
as a species of <i>preventive punishment</i>, which excited much attention and
terror to evil doers, and proved eminently useful in decreasing the number
of commitments; the strict discipline had a most salutary effect upon the
prisoners not easily to be forgotten. Yet, the inventor’s name gave rise
to many jokes on the subject among such of the prisoners who could laugh
at their own crimes, who said that they were now punished by the <i>cubit</i>!</p>

<p>In nearly all the new and fa&mdash;vour&mdash;ite comic songs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> day allusion
was made to the <span class="smcap">Treadmill of Brixton</span> as&mdash;<i>The Everlasting Stairs!&mdash;The
Stepping Mill!&mdash;The New Dancing Academy! &amp;c.</i> A street-ballad on the
subject was issued from the “Catnach Press” and had a most unprecedented
sale, keeping the pressmen and boys working for weeks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“And we’re all treading, tread, tread, treading,<br />
And we’re all treading, at fam’d Brixton Mill.”</p>

<p>The following punning ditty was very popular at the period:&mdash;</p>

As every <i>step</i> which here they take,<br />

<br />
And when releas’d, and in the streets<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It brings a <i>Revolution</i>.</span><br />
<br />
But though these snarlers show their teeth,<br />

Their actions soon are <i>tried</i> and <i>judg’d</i>,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To my friends in this place,</span><br />
That <i>chaffing</i> and <i>milling</i><br />

<tr><td>Come all ye swells and sporting blades who love to see good fun,<br />
Who in the dark, to have a lark, a mile or two would run;<br />
Here’s a dish of entertainment which cannot fail to please,<br />
The rigs of Tom and Jerry, and all their jolly sprees.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their dash along, flash along, to Life and London haste away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where sprees and rambles, larks and gambols, is the time of day.</span><br />
<br />
From Hawthorn-Hall young Jerry came to see his cousin Tom,<br />
And with his friend Bob Logic acquainted soon became,<br />
Then to cut a dash, he learns the flash, to act high life and low,<br />
And up and down through all the town at night they rambling go.<br />
<br />
In a morning at Tattersall’s you may them often see,<br />
’Mong jockies, grooms, and chaunters, a knowing company;<br />
In the afternoon they’re lounging in Burlington Arcade,<br />
And at night they’re at the Opera, Ball, or Masquerade.<br />
<br />
Among the milling kiddy coves young Jerry took delight,<br />
And was always first to raise a purse to have a glorious fight.<br />
A Fancy blade he then became, and his courage ran so high,<br />
That in his room, he floor’d his groom, and black’d his valet’s eye.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span><br />
Then off to Leicester-fields they’d march, the Strand, or Drury-lane<br />
Among the sporting ladies to carry on the game,<br />
They’d take them to a gin-shop and treat them round so civil,<br />
Then spur them on to fight and scratch each other like the devil.<br />
<br />
While rambling up and down one night they came to Temple-Bar,<br />
And to have a spree, they did agree, ’gainst the Charlies to make war,<br />
Then in the twinkling of an eye a watch-box was upset,<br />
The Watchy roar’d till all was blue, but out he could not get.<br />
<br />
They smash’d their lanterns, kick’d their shins, and did their pipkins crack,<br />
And laid them down so neatly one by one upon their backs,<br />
The prigs and sporting ladies all joined in the row,<br />
But Jerry, Tom, and Logic by the pigs [watchmen] were ta’en in tow.<br />
<br />
Then to the Holy Land they went disguis’d from top to toe,<br />
To see the Beggar’s Opera where all the Cadgers go,<br />
With Mahogany Bet they had a lark, Black Moll, and Dumpling Kate,<br />
And treated all the apple-women with a yard of tape [gin].<br />
<br />
Now, with your leave good folks I will conclude my flashy song,<br />
I hope you’re entertained, and I’ve not detain’d you long,<br />
And Logic, Tom, and Jerry, do cordially unite,<br />
To thank you for your patronage, and wish you all Good Night.<br />

have been pleased with the work. The thirty-six scenes from Real Life,

success, and everybody seems to have made a great deal of money out of the
circumstance&mdash;save and except the author, Pierce Egan, for he very loudly
and frequently, and also “<i>cry-baby-like</i>,” declared <i>inter alia</i>, that he
received&mdash;“more of the kicks than the halfpence” by reason of the
<i>Pirates</i> and <i>Thieves</i> being ever on the alert to <i>prig</i> his thoughts and
ideas, and that the whole crew of them united to <i>grab</i> all the “<i>lively
things!</i>” out of his head, and so render the “cash account” at his bankers
all but nugatory. Then&mdash;“came the cry of immorality, so loudly raised by
the Actor’s old rivals the Religious Tract Society, the Methodists, and
other sectarian parties.” Yet, in spite of all that could be said or sung
in the matter Pierce wrote that&mdash;“he was <i>too game</i> to be made a <i>dummy</i>
of: therefore he was determined <i>to take the leap</i>, and have another
“<i>shy-up</i>,” and go “<i>double or quits</i>,” with that supreme goddess of the
gods FAME!!! and try his luck once more in the field of literature and
announced the publication of his new work <i>The Finish</i> thus:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">The AUTHOR to the READERS of<br />
LIFE<br />
IN and OUT of LONDON.</span></p>

<p>After the lapse of Seven Years the Author has once more seized hold of the
<i>feather</i>, and the Artist his <i>pencil</i>, with an earnest endeavour to
follow the advice of our immortal bard, or rather adopt him as a model,
“nothing to extenuate, or set down aught in malice!” and:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 14em;">To hold as ’twere</span><br />
The Mirror up to Nature; to show Virtue her own feature,<br />
Vice her own image, and the very age<br />
And body of the Time, its form and pressure.</p>

<p>Then thus it is&mdash;the “glorious uncertainty” of pleasing every class of
society respecting a knowledge of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span> being essential towards
the improvement of the junior branches of mankind; and although contrary
to the established and sapient rules of the College of Physicians, and the
practice pursued by our learned friends in Westminster Hall, we are,
nevertheless, anxious to give advice without a fee, in order to prove
that, in all cases, whether connected with youth or more mature age,
<span class="smcap">Prevention</span> is much better than <span class="smcap">Cure</span>; indeed, so anxious are we to set
ourselves right with the public, as to our future intentions respecting
this work, and that we may see our way clearly, and tread on the firmest
ground, we feel inclined to adopt the latin proverb so often quoted by <span class="smcap">Bob
Logic</span> to the unsuspecting <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, on his first arrival in the metropolis:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim.</i></p>

<p>The necessity is absolute; or, rather, an apology is required for the
introduction of the Author and Artist to the notice of reader, previous to
the second appearance of those heroes&mdash;<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span>, <span class="smcap">Logic</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, on
the great theatre of the world! <i>pour quoi?</i> to vindicate the characters
of the Author and Artist from unmerited aspersion of having attempted, by
the joint efforts of real tales, original anecdotes, and animated
sketches, to demoralize the rising generation; and likewise to refute the
charge of having turned the heads of older folks towards the commission of
acts of folly and intemperance enough! To our task&mdash;&mdash;“Hark forward’s the
word, see the game is in view!” and our exertions will be vigorously
directed to establish, if possible. “<i>Tâche sans tâche.</i>” Our principal
aim being to realize, to the utmost extent, the attractive motto:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hope <span class="smcap">Logic</span> will be able to accompany us in our visit to <span class="smcap">Lord Liberal’s</span>
Gallery,” said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, when he was interrupted by the footman putting the
following letter into his hand&mdash;“Aye,” observed <span class="smcap">Tom</span> to <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, “here is a
note from <span class="smcap">Bob</span>; let us hear what he has to offer upon the subject:&mdash;”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Tom,</span></p>

<p>I regret very much that my health will not permit me to accompany you
and the “Young One” to view my <span class="smcap">Lord Liberal’s</span> fine gallery of
paintings; a pleasure which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> sincerely anticipated, as it is
well known that his Lordship’s taste respecting the fine arts, is
considerably above <i>par</i>. But “<i>necessitas non habet legem!</i>” To tell
you the truth, I am seriously ill, although not alarmed; yet, I must
confess, that I never felt so <i>strangely</i> in the whole course of my
life. I think the <i>volume</i> is nearly <i>spun</i> out; and that the <span class="smcap">Book</span>
will soon be closed for ever! But <span class="smcap">Dr. Finish’em</span> will not have it so,
nay, he insists on the contrary, “Lots of <i>pages</i>,” says he, “yet
remain to be <i>read</i>;” and several <span class="smcap">Chapters</span> must be <i>perused</i>, before
you arrive at that emphatical word&mdash;FINIS! Be that as it may; you are
aware that doctors differ, and I do not like appearances; yet, as we
say at Oxford, <i>forti et fideli nil difficile</i>! Nevertheless, I am
anxious to see you, my dear friend, as soon as convenient; and I wish
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> to be your companion, as I have something to communicate to both
of you, rather of a <i>serious</i> nature, concerning myself; yet, I am far
from labouring under <i>un cœur contrit</i>. Therefore tell the “Young
One,” I hope his person is now quite <i>cool</i>&mdash;that his flame is also
<i>cool</i>; and instead of lamenting over the&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;I am happy to
hear he is <i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">I remain, my dear <span class="smcap">Tom</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Yours, truly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><span class="smcap">Robert Logic</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Corinthian Tom, Esq.</i></p></div>

<p>“There’s something behind this letter that I do not like,” said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>; “<span class="smcap">Bob</span>
is very ill, you may rely upon it, or else he would not be so pressing for
us to visit him.” “Yes, I am afraid it is too true,” replied <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; “but
let us hope he is not so bad, neither, as you perceive, he is <i>joking</i>
about my late affair.” “Joke with you!” echoed <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, “I expect <span class="smcap">Logic</span> will
die with a <i>joke</i> in his mouth, he is so fond of <i>punning</i>? But we will
lose no time, as I am anxious to ascertain the true cause of his illness.”</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of our heroes at the apartments of <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, they found him
sitting at a table, in his arm chair, with pens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> and ink before him: his
countenance most woefully changed for the worse. Indeed, <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>
were quite shocked with his altered appearance in so short a time. He
endeavoured to smile upon them, as usual; but it savoured more of the
“<i>ghastly!</i>” than that sort of enlivening humour which so generally
imparted animation to his cheerful face. “I am very glad to see you, my
boys,” said he, “before I start on my long journey, which I have been
preparing for these last five or six days.” “I was not aware you had any
such intention,” answered <span class="smcap">Tom</span>; “but may I ask, where are you going?”</p>

<p class="center">“To that bourne from whence no traveller returns!”</p>

<p>replied <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, accompanied by a most penetrating look at the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>.
“<span class="smcap">Dr. Finish’em</span> has given me my <i>quietus</i>, like an honest fellow. On
feeling my pulse, he observed&mdash;“Your <i>hour-glass</i> is almost run out!
<i>Tempus fugit!</i> Therefore, what you have to do, let it be done quickly, or
else it will not be done at all!” <i>Old Bolus</i>, too, was rather funny with
me on the occasion; “I know,” said he, “your <span class="smcap">Will</span> was always good to serve
everybody; therefore, <span class="smcap">Mr. Logic</span>, have a good WILL now towards your
friends.” I took <i>Pill</i> and <i>Potions</i> advice, and the few hours allotted
to me I have made the best use of that I possibly could; and here is my
WILL for your approbation.” The tear started down <span class="smcap">Tom’s</span> cheek, and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>
was much affected by the unexpected circumstance. “I sincerely hope it is
not so bad as you apprehend,” said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>. “Yes, my dear friends,” replied
<span class="smcap">Logic</span>, “it is all over with me. I have suffered severely from an
inflammation in my bowels; but the pain has subsided, and that is the sign
of approaching death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> You will perceive, on looking over my
TESTAMENT,<a name='fna_39' id='fna_39' href='#f_39'><small>[39]</small></a> that I have not adhered to any of the technical terms of
lawyers, being well aware that the distribution of my property will never
puzzle the pericranium of the <i>Lord Chancellor</i>, or occasion a row among
the <i>learned</i> brethren, to obtain a brief upon the subject; and if I have
not made myself perfectly intelligible, I hope you will now point out any
errors that may appear to you, in order to avoid disputes hereafter. It is
true, I have no <i>blunt</i> to leave you, my boys, but several <i>notes</i>, which
I hope, will always bear an interest, and prove as <i>valuable</i> to you in
the hour of need&mdash;as <i>cash</i>! You will, my dear <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, as my last request,
read it aloud, for the approbation of my friend <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">THE LAST WORDS AND TESTAMENT OF ROBERT LOGIC.</p>

<p>Being wide <i>awake</i>&mdash;my <span class="smcaplc">UPPER STORY</span> in perfect repair&mdash;and <i>down</i> to what I
am about&mdash;I have seized hold of the <i>feather</i>, with a firm hand, to render
myself intelligible, and also to communicate the objects I have in view; I
give and bequeath unto my friend, <span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span>, Esq., my <i>tile</i>, my
<i>castor</i>, my <i>topper</i>, my <i>upper-crust</i>, my <i>pimple coverer</i>, otherwise <span class="smcaplc">MY</span>
HAT, which, I hope, will never be the means of changing the appearance of
“an old friend with a new face.” To my out and out friend and companion,
<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span>, I give my <i>spread</i>, my <i>summer-cabbage</i>, my <i>water-plant</i>,
but more generally understood as my <span class="smcap">Umbrella</span>; who, I feel assured will
never let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> be made use of as a <i>shelter</i> for duplicity, ingratitude, or
hum-buggery of any sort! Also, to <span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span>, Esq., I resign my
<i>fam-snatchers</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, my <span class="smcap">Gloves</span>, under the consideration, if ever he
should part with them, that they are only to be worn by those persons, who
have “a <i>hand</i> to give, and a <i>heart</i> that forgives!” Likewise to <span class="smcap">Jerry
Hawthorn</span>, Esq., I bequeath my <i>four-eyes</i>, my <i>barnacles</i>, my
<i>green-specs</i>, but amongst opticians, denominated <span class="smcap">Spectacles</span>. It is my
sincere wish, that nothing <i>green</i> will be ever seen appertaining to them,
except their <i>colour</i>; I also hope they will not, upon any occasion
whatever <i>magnify</i> <span class="smcap">Trifles</span> into <i>difficulties</i>: but enable the wearer to
see his way through <span class="smcap">Life</span> as clear as <i>crystal</i>! I press upon <span class="smcap">Jerry
Hawthorn</span>, Esq., his acceptance of my <i>fogle</i>, my <i>wipe</i>, my <i>clout</i>, my
<i>sneezer</i>, politely termed a <span class="smcap">Silk Handkerchief</span>. This article has often
been used to <i>wipe</i> off a tear of pity, and always forthcoming at a tale
of <i>distress</i>; may it ever be at <i>hand</i> on such Christian-like occasions!
To <span class="smcap">Philip Timothy Splinter</span>, Esq., I bequeath my <i>upper tog</i>, my
<i>Benjaman</i>, my <i>wrapper</i>, generally called a <span class="smcap">Top Coat</span>, with the advice,
that however it may be <i>mended</i> and <i>mended</i> again, he will never let it
be <i>turned</i> against unavoidable misfortune, and charity. My <i>ticker</i>, my
<i>tatler</i>, my <i>thimble</i>, otherwise my <span class="smcap">Watch</span>, I bequeath to <span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span>,
Esq., as an emblematical gift to keep <span class="smcap">Time</span> upon all occasions&mdash;to remember
its inestimable value, and also to recollect that he will, some day or
another, be <i>wound-up</i> for the last <i>time</i>. My two <span class="smcap">Seals</span> I give conjointly
to my most valued and dear friends, <span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry Hawthorn</span>,
Esqrs., in order, if possible, that the bonds of friendship may be more
firmly <i>sealed</i> between them, to the end of their lives. To Miss <span class="smcap">Mary
Rosebud</span>, I give and bequeath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
my <span class="smcap">Diamond Ring</span>, as a representative of her
excellent brilliant qualities, and also as a golden fence, to secure her
virtue, reputation, and dignity. To my worthy friend, Sir <span class="smcap">John Blubber</span>,
Knt. I give and bequeath my <i>padders</i>, my <i>stampers</i>, my <i>buckets</i>,
otherwise my <span class="smcap">Boots</span>, whose knowledge of mankind, united with kindness
towards the failings of others, teaches him to tread lightly o’er the
ashes of the dead! To prevent mistakes respecting my <span class="smcap">Bit</span>, I have not a
<i>bit</i> to leave; it having been with me, for some time past&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pockets</span> to
<span class="smcap">Let</span>, unfurnished; <i>Sic transit gloria mundi!</i> But nevertheless, I trust I
have always proved <i>amicus humani generis</i>! My <span class="smcap">Books</span> having been long
<i>booked</i> for their value, and afforded me consolation and support in the
hour of need&mdash;I, therefore, leave as I found it, for other folks to bustle
in, that <span class="smcap">Great Volume</span>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">World</span>! which upon all occasions, was my
sheet-anchor! assisted by the following good old maxims, as my guide:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Tempus edax rerum.</i>&mdash;Time that devours all things.<br />
<i>Vincit veritas.</i>&mdash;Truth conquors.<br />
<i>Principiis obsta.</i>&mdash;Resist the first beginnings.<br />
<i>Vitiis nemo sine nascitur.</i>&mdash;No man without his faults.<br />
<i>Spes mea in Deo.</i>&mdash;My hope is in God.<br />
<i>Spero meliora.</i>&mdash;I hope for better things.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;"><span class="smcap">Robert Logic.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> were both considerably affected at the kindness displayed
towards them by the <i>Oxonian</i>; and had it been at any other time, the
singularity of the above <i>Testament</i> would have produced much laughter
between them; at all events, it convinced them that <span class="smcap">Logic</span> still preserved
his <i>character</i> for <span class="smcaplc">ORIGINALITY</span>. Three proper witnesses, disinterested
persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> belonging to the house, were instantly called in to sign it,
when the Testament, in the eye of the law, became a valid document. “My
dear <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,” said <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, “as we must soon part, I had intended to offer a
few remarks for your consideration; but, finding that my strength will not
second my intentions, I shall be very concise on the matter: you must
perceive that the <i>comical</i> part of my career is at an end, and you are
well aware that I always was a merry fellow; but, as <i>Mercutio</i> says, I
shall be found a <i>grave</i> man to-morrow. Endeavour, then, “To do unto all
men, as you would they should do unto you,” and you will not be a great
way off the right path to happiness. I feel myself very faint; my breath
getting short; and having settled everything to my satisfaction, have the
kindness to assist me into bed, that I may die like a
Christian&mdash;contented, and in peace with all mankind! Tom, give me your
hand; <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, yours likewise&mdash;I grasp them both with sincerity!” Then
looking them full in the face; with a placid smile on his countenance, his
last words were&mdash;“God bless you!” His lip fell; his eyes lost their
brilliancy; and the once-merry, lively, facetious, friendly <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, was now
numbered with the dead!</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img65.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>For several days, our heroes were absorbed in grief, at the sudden loss of
their much-admired and valued friend; and <span class="smcap">Corinthian House</span>, for a long
time after the decease of the <i>Oxonian</i>, was dull in the extreme. The
funeral of <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, under the direction of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, was of the most splendid
description; and a handsome monument was also erected by his order,
bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><b>This Tablet</b><br />
Was erected in remembrance of<br />
<span class="gesp"><span class="large"><b>ROBERT LOGIC, Esq.,</b></span></span><br />
Who was viewed throughout the circle of his acquaintances as<br />
A MAN,<br />
In every sense of the word,<br />
<span class="smcap">Valuable as Gold</span>!<br />
<span class="smcap">Mirth</span> and <span class="smcap">Good Humour</span> were always at his elbows; but<br />
DULL CARE<br />
Was never allowed a seat in his presence.<br />
He played the <i>first fiddle</i> in all companies, and was never out<br />
of tune:<br />
<span class="smcap">Bob</span> was a wit of the first quality;<br />
But his <span class="smcap">Satire</span> was general, and levelled against the follies<br />
of mankind:<br />
<span class="smcap">Personality</span> and <span class="smcap">Scandal</span> he disclaimed:<br />
His exertions were always directed to make others happy.<br />
As a <span class="smcap">Choice Spirit</span>, he was unequalled;<br />
And as a <span class="smcap">Sincere Friend</span>, never excelled; but in his character of a<br />
MAN OF THE WORLD,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><span class="smcap">Bob Logic</span> was a Mirror to all his Companions.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mankind</span> had been his study; and he had perused the Great<br />
<b>Book of Life</b><br />
With superior advantages; and his <span class="smcap">Commentaries</span> on<br />
<span class="smcap">Men and Manners</span><br />
Displayed not only an enlarged mind; but his <span class="smcap">Opinions</span> were<br />
gentlemanly and liberal.<br />
His intimate knowledge of <span class="smcap">Vice</span> had preserved him from<br />
being <span class="smcap">Vicious</span>.<br />
By which source he was able to discriminate with effect; and<br />
<span class="smcap">Virtue</span> appeared more beautiful in his eyes.<br />
<span class="smcap">Truth</span> was his polar star; and <span class="smcap">Integrity</span> his sheet anchor.<br />
<span class="smcap">Adversity</span> could not reduce his noble mind,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Prosperity</span> was not suffered to play tricks with his feelings;<br />
HE WAS A MAN UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES!<br />
<span class="smcap">Flattery</span> he despised; while <span class="smcap">Candour</span> obtained his respect;<br />
and the corner stone of his character was&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sincerity</span>.<br />
He was charitable, but not ostentatious, and a well-wisher to<br />
all the world.<br />
His Friends,<br />
<span class="large">TOM AND JERRY,</span><br />
Lamenting his severe loss in society, trust, that upon the<br />
AWFUL, DAY OF RECKONING,<br />
The Great Auditor of Accounts will find his <span class="smcap">Balance Sheet</span><br />
correct, (<i>errors excepted</i>):<br />
And as the whole tenour of <span class="smcap">Bob Logic’s</span> life had been <span class="smcap">A Volume<br />

<span class="smcap">Well Bound</span> at the last!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">“<i>There is no place like Home!</i>” <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> <i>bids adieu to</i> <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>,

to promote</i> <span class="smcap">Life in the Country</span>.</p></div>

<p>The sudden death of <span class="smcap">Logic</span> made quite a <i>chasm</i> in the movements of <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span>; indeed he had been the principal caterer for their amusements, and
our heroes were not only in grief for his loss, but reduced completely to
a <i>stand-still</i> without him. It is true; <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> had previously made up his
mind to quit London, but the sudden demise of the <i>Oxonian</i> positively
hurried him out of town. The Metropolis had lost its attractions upon the
feelings of <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, and he flattered himself that the neighbourhood of
<span class="smcap">Hawthorn Hall</span>, the sports of the field, and the fascinating company of
<span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span>, would, in a great measure, afford relief to his mind, and
ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> restore him to cheerfulness. The parents of <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> were
overjoyed in beholding their darling son once more safe under their roof,
and the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> also received the most friendly congratulations on his
arrival at Hawthorn Hall. The <i>sombre</i> appearance of our heroes, who were
in deep mourning for the <i>Oxonian</i>, operated as a great drawback to the
festivities which under different circumstances, had been intended to
celebrate their reception; indeed, at every step they took, the loss of
Logic was sincerely regretted by all those persons who had ranked him as
one of their best acquaintances, during his last appearance at <span class="smcap">Hawthorn
Hall</span>. “To me, the loss of <span class="smcap">Logic</span> is incalculable,” said Jerry, to his
father; “he was not only able to advise, but his manner of doing it was so
persuasive, that it was impossible not to benefit by his experience; more
especially at my time of life, when such experience was by far more
valuable to my mind, than any knowledge I might have obtained of men and
manners, through my own exertions!”</p>

<p>Our hero lost no time in visiting Rosebud Cottage. On his entrance he was
welcomed by the father of our heroine with no common sort of ardour; but,
on his being ushered into the presence of <span class="smcap">Mary Rosebud</span>, he felt confused,
nay, ashamed; her looks, although accompanied with a smile, nevertheless
told him that he had been neglectful towards her, during his residence in
London, and she gently chided him for his want of attention. “I am afraid,
Sir,” said she, “it has been with you like most professed lovers, ‘out of
sight, out of mind.’” <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> could not reply; his excuses were lame and
impotent; indeed, he was aware that he was in fault, and, therefore,
sensibly threw himself upon the mercy of the Court, and sued in the most
persuasive manner for pardon. The good nature of <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, aided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> by a little
of something else&mdash;perhaps, love&mdash;could not resist the application; and
she generously admitted that some allowance might be made for him, when
surrounded by the attractions of London. “Generous girl!” exclaimed <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,
“the remainder of my life shall be devoted to your happiness.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> being now perfectly established in the good opinion of <span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span>,
became doubly attentive in his visits; when the minutes, the hours, the
days, nay, the weeks almost appeared to fly, so fascinated was <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> with
the company and attractions of our charming heroine. In truth, the time of
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was completely occupied with hunting, dinners, card-parties,
assemblies, &amp;c., accompanied by <span class="smcap">Tom</span>; and his life appeared so happy, that
he congratulated himself on his return to the seat of his father, also
upon the hair-breadth escapes he had met with, during his Day and Night
Scenes in London.</p>

<p>During a walk one fine evening, and Hawthorn Church appearing in view,
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was determined to make the best use of the opportunity which offered
itself, by soliciting <span class="smcap">Mary Rosebud</span> to name the day that was to complete
his happiness. “I have always promised my father,” replied <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, with the
utmost frankness, “that he should name the wedding-day; therefore, gain
his consent, and you will have no complaint to make against my decision.”
“I will be your father upon that joyful occasion,” said the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>,
“if you will permit me, my dear <span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span>, as I am very anxious to
bestow on my friend <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> one of the greatest treasures in this life,&mdash;a
most amiable companion and virtuous wife.” <span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span> blushed at the
remark, but nevertheless felt pleased with the compliment paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> by the
<span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>; and the subject was dropped until they arrived at Rosebud
Cottage. The father of our heroine, on being made acquainted with the
wishes of the young folks, observed, “I am quite content; and I sincerely
hope they will prove one of the happiest couples alive. Therefore, let the
settlements be drawn immediately, the licence procured without delay, the
dresses made offhand, our friends invited in good time, and <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>
requested to hold himself in readiness. Now, having settled this marriage
business to my mind, let us have a jolly evening together, before we part;
and to-morrow, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, what do you say to a day’s hunting? And your cousin,
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>, I have no doubt, will make one of the party.” “It will afford me
great pleasure,” replied the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>; “and we will be in time to start
with you.” The evening was spent in great jollity.&mdash;“The single married,
and the married happy,” were toasted over and over again by the party,
until <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> became as lively as a lark, <span class="smcap">Old Rosebud</span> roaring out the view
halloo! The <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> quite merry and facetious, and <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span> rather
above par, hiccoughing, every now and then, with an attempt to pun, that
he was “fond of (<i>a</i>) <i>good living</i>!”</p>

<p>Our heroes were ready at the appointed time to take the field with <span class="smcap">Old
Rosebud</span>; the latter fox-hunter was in high glee with the excellence of the
day’s sport, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> equally delighted, and <span class="smcap">Tom</span> had just declared he had not
been so pleased for a long time; but, unfortunately for him, in his bold
endeavour to clear some high palings, his horse fell with him, and he was
thrown some distance. On being raised from the ground, it was discovered
that his neck was dislocated, and he expired instantly. Upon <span class="smcap">Jerry’s</span>
ascertaining the fate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>, his feelings were so completely
overcome, that he fell down in a fit quite senseless.</p>

<p>To describe the wretched state of mind which <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> suffered for several
days, at the unexpected accident and melancholy death of his dearest
friend in the world would have baffled the poet’s skill and the painter’s
talents to pourtray&mdash;the shock was so sudden, and the loss to our hero so
great, that it was impossible to have been otherwise; just at the moment
when happiness appeared to be within his grasp, and he was also slowly
recovering from the serious effects which the death of <span class="smcap">Logic</span> had also made
upon his feelings, to have met with such an immense blow&mdash;the death of
<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span>&mdash;shattered his nerves all to pieces, and anything in the
shape of consolation appeared to him officious, troublesome, and
unavailing! Ultimately, by the soothing attention of <span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span>, the
friendly interference of the old fox hunter, her father, the unremitting
kindness of his parents, and the cheering, good advice of <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>, by
degrees he was restored to a state of convalescence.</p>

<p>From “<span class="smcap">Gay</span> to <i>grave</i>,” was now the reversed scene for the contemplation of
our hero, and the old proverb verified to an awful extent, “that many
things happen between the cup and the lip;” the <i>marriage rites</i> were now
suspended to make way for the performance of the burial service. The
remains of the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> were conveyed to town with the utmost solemnity,
and interred in the family vault, with all those obsequies due to his
rank; and although <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> remained extremely ill, and scarcely able to
stand upon his legs, yet he was determined, at all hazards, to pay the
last respect to his most valued friend and relative, <span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span>, by
his appearance at the funeral in the character of chief mourner. <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> did
not quit the Metropolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> until he had settled every thing to his
satisfaction respecting the interment of the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>. Upon the return
of <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> to <span class="smcap">Hawthorn Hall</span>, several days elapsed before anything like
pleasure occupied his mind; he positively refused to quit the house, and
he also shunned the society of his acquaintances. “It requires no common
fortitude,” observed <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, to <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>, “to bear up against the loss
of two such invaluable friends as <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, snatched, as it were, in
an instant from me, when I stood most in need of their assistance, and to
whom I am principally indebted for the knowledge of mankind which I now
possess. In <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, I have lost a model of experience, a fund of talent,
and a heart overflowing with the milk of human kindness. By the death of
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>, I shall heavily miss that urbanity, discernment and liberality, which
highly distinguishes the polished, and thorough-bred gentleman. I am now
left to decide for myself; but, nevertheless, I hope I shall sincerely
profit by their example. <span class="smcap">Appearances</span>, I am perfectly aware might be
against both of their characters with the fastidious part of society, yet
hypocrisy, cant, humbug, or dissimulation, never disgraced their conduct:
a love of honour shone conspicuously throughout their actions, and, by an
acknowledgment of their own errors, displayed a noble generosity towards
the faults of others. They taught me not to spend time in regretting any
mistakes that I had made, but to exert myself upon every occasion to
repair them. This maxim shall be my guide through life&mdash;I will not repine,
but struggle with fortitude against unavoidable calamities, and endeavour
to make myself happy under all circumstances of my existences.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> immediately gave orders for a very handsome stone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> be placed in
the most conspicuous situation near to the spot where <span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> lost
his life, with the following inscription engraved upon it:&mdash;</p>

<b>Steward’s Book</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>“I admit your loss has been great, and I also admire the tenour of your
argument,” observed Mr. <span class="smcap">Rosebud</span>, “but, nevertheless, ‘grieving’s a folly;’
there is a time for every thing, as my friend <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span> would have
observed, therefore, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, having done every thing becoming the character
of a sincere friend, I think you ought now to turn to a more pleasant view
of the picture, and once more give your acquaintances the benefit of your
company.” “Good!” exclaimed <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>; “for some time past, I have been
holding myself in readiness to receive a summons to perform a certain
ceremony, without <span class="smcap">Squire Hawthorn</span> has given up the marriage altogether.
All in good time perhaps!”</p>

<p>The trifling hint was quite sufficient, and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, lest his conduct should
be thought cold or neglectful, presented himself, in the course of the
morning, “for better or for worse,” to Miss <span class="smcap">Rosebud</span>, at the Cottage,
anxiously soliciting her to name the wedding day. The disposition of <span class="smcap">Mary
Rosebud</span> was of the most ingenious nature, and her attachment to our hero
too great to keep him long in suspense. “Perhaps, Sir,” said <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, “I
ought to say ‘No!’&mdash;and insist upon more time, to enable me to form a
correct opinion of your conduct, whether you have duly considered the
serious and important charge of martrimony, and the confinement also
attendant on such a state; and, likewise, freely consenting, as it is
termed, to surrender a part of your liberty, before I say ‘<span class="smcap">Yes</span>.’ But I
prefer being frank on the present occasion; and, relying on your honour,
generosity, and true love, I am content, whenever my father shall think
proper to name the day.” “Generous, amiable girl,” replied <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, “I have
well considered the subject, in every point of view; but I will make no
professions: yet my endeavours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> throughout my life, shall be to
<i>strengthen</i>, what the Poet has so beautifully described, the</p>

<p class="center">“Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets.”</p>

<p>The day was immediately fixed for the nuptials by Mr. <span class="smcap">Rosebud</span>; the
marriage ceremony was performed by <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>, and when <span class="smcap">Miss Rosebud</span>
answered “I will!” the old Curate was so full of joy, that the word
“<span class="smcap">Good!</span>” had almost escaped his lips. The estates of the Rosebuds and the
Hawthorns were united, and <span class="smcap">Mary</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> made the happiest of the happy.
The wedding-day was devoted to pleasure. “It shall be kept in the old
style,” said <span class="smcap">Jerry’s</span> father; “every body, shall be welcome; we will have a
dance upon the green; all the lads and lasses in the village shall be
invited to celebrate the wedding; we will broach a tub of ‘<i>humming
bub!!</i>’ and nothing shall be wanting to promote mirth and harmony.”
“Good!” said <span class="smcap">Old Jollyboy</span>, over his pipe; but, long before the approach of
night, the “gaily circulating glass” had been pushed about by <span class="smcap">Old Hawthorn</span>
to all the company&mdash;that, suffice to observe; as we have too much respect
for the cloth to tell tales, the fine old Curate required the assistance
of “<span class="smcap">Amen</span>,” the clerk, to make <span class="smcap">Jollyboy</span> “all right” at the Curacy.</p>

<p>The honey-moon was, of course, a raptuous one; after which <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> might be
viewed as a “<i>settled being</i>.” Time rolled over pleasantly with him and
his bride; and the sports of the field, if possible, he enjoyed with
greater zest than heretofore. His fire-side was a pattern of domestic
comfort, although a sigh would now and then escape his lips, whenever the
thoughts of <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Logic</span> came over his mind. In every other respect,
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was a picture of contentment; determined to profit by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> his
experience, and to turn to a good account, for the benefit of himself and
his family, the many hair-breadth escapes and dangerous adventures he had
met with in his <span class="smcap">Day</span> and <span class="smcap">Night Scenes</span> in <span class="smcap">Life</span> in London. He was the delight
of all the companies he visited in the neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">Hawthorn Hall</span>; his
general conduct was the praise of the surrounding gentry, and he was
admitted, by all parties, to sustain the character of a perfect <span class="smcap">Country
Gentleman</span>. We now take our leave of <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, “all happiness,” with his
amiable wife, a fine estate, a capital stud of horses, and a crack pack of
hounds, to promote&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Ace of Spades.</b>&mdash;A widow.</p>

<p><b>Adelphi.</b>&mdash;Greek for brothers: several streets on the south side of the
Strand, London, erected about 1768 by the brothers, John, Robert, James,
and William Adam, after whom the streets are named.</p>

<p><b>Adelphi Theatre.</b>&mdash;Formerly called the <i>Sans Pareil</i>, opened under the
management of Mr. and Miss Scott, 27 Nov., 1806. Messrs. Rodwell and Jones
purchased the property and opened on Monday, Oct. 18, 1819, and issued the
first playbill bearing the name of “Adelphi Theatre.” Messrs. Mathews and
Yates became managers, Sept. 29, 1828&mdash;Mr. Charles Mathews&mdash;<i>Mathews at
Home</i>&mdash;died the 28th of June, 1835. The theatre was then let for the
remainder of the season to Messrs. Ephraim Bond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> Company, and
announced to be “under the management of Mrs. Nisbett.” After that Mr.
Yates had the sole management. In 1840 Messrs. Yates and Gladstone were
the proprietors. Mr. Benjamin Webster became lessee, and Madame Celeste
directress, 1844. The theatre was re-built and opened, with improved
arrangements 27 Dec., 1858, as The New Adelphi. In 1870 it was announced
that while Mr. Ben. Webster was sole proprietor, Mr. Webster and Mr. F. B.
Chatterton were joint managers. After several changes Messrs. A. and S.
Gatti became sole proprietors and managers.</p>

<p><b>Air and Exercise.</b>&mdash;Or, <i>Shoving the tumbler</i>. Being whipped at the cart’s
tail.</p>

<p><b>Alderman.</b>&mdash;A turkey, <i>Alderman in chains</i>, a roast turkey well-stuffed and
garnished with pork sausages; the latter emblematical of the gold chain
worn by that civic dignitary.</p>

<p><b>Ale Draper.</b>&mdash;The alehouse-keeper; a <i>rum cull</i>, a <i>squirt quester</i>. <i>Ale
spinner</i>, a brewer or publican.</p>

<p><b>Alive.</b>&mdash;Active, smart, to be ever on the alert. <i>Alive</i> to the subject;
the game, the fact, or to any circumstance. Tom’s <i>alive</i> to his own
interest, let him alone for that; he’s <i>wide-a-wake</i>!</p>

<p><b>All Hands to the Pump.</b>&mdash;All force concentrated to one spot.</p>

<p><b>All-Max in the East.</b>&mdash;Open to all influenced by none&mdash;was held at the
Coach and Horses public-house, Nightingale-lane, East Smithfield, and was
frequented by most of the Wapping <i>elegantes</i>. <span class="smcap">Blue Ruin</span> and reels were
generally the <i>order</i>&mdash;rather the <i>dis</i>order of the evening.</p>

<p><b>All Out.</b>&mdash;The whole of the reckoning. “How stands the great account t’wixt
me and vengeance!”</p>

<p><b>Almack’s.</b>&mdash;Aristocratic exclusiveness. A ball given by the highest
nobility. Almack’s means properly a suite of assembly rooms in King
Street, St. James’s, London, built in 1765 by a Scotchman named Macall,
who inverted his name to obviate all prejudice and hide his origin. Balls,
presided over by a committee of ladies of the highest rank, used to be
given in these rooms; and to be admitted to them was as great a
distinction as to be introduced at Court. The rooms are now called
Willis’s from the present proprietor.</p>

<p class="poem">If once to <span class="smcap">Almack’s</span> you belong,<br />
Like <span class="smcap">Monarch’s</span>, you can <i>do no wrong</i>;<br />
But banished thence on Wednesday night,<br />
By Jove, you can do nothing right.</p>

<p><b>Alone.</b>&mdash;A knowing one may be trusted “<i>Alone</i>” by reason of his experience
in worldly matters.</p>

<p><b>Angelics.</b>&mdash;Young ladies. N.B. <i>Unmarried!</i></p>

<p><b>Annointed.</b>&mdash;Knowing, ripe for mischief, full of courage and energy for any
desperate exploit.</p>

<p><b>Apartments to Let.</b>&mdash;It is said that the “widow’s cap,” denotes that there
are <i>Apartments to Let</i>! Also of an empty-headed or <i>shallow-cove</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span><b>Argument.</b>&mdash;The best of the. Any man with a pair of leather lungs has the
best of an argument at a tavern, unless there be an other present who can
lay heavy sums which are quite <i>uncoverable</i> that <i>his</i> opinion or
assertion is correct. A stable-keeper being beaten in argument by one of
the leather-lunged breed, produced a large roll of bank-notes and a
handful of sovereigns, smacking them down on the table exclaiming, “There
you &mdash;&mdash; look at that; if I am a fool my money’s none. <i>That beats you!</i>”</p>

<p><b>Arm Pits.</b>&mdash;<i>To work under the arm pits</i>, is to practise only such
depredations as will amount on conviction to transportation. By following
this course and system, a thief avoids the <i>halter</i>, or <i>neck-squeezer</i>!
which certainly is applied <i>above</i> the arm pits.</p>

<p><b>Arm Props.</b>&mdash;Crutches.&mdash;Go it ye cripples <i>crutches</i> are cheap.</p>

<p><b>Astley’s Amphitheatre.</b>&mdash;Was built and opened by Philip Astley, 1773.</p>

<p><b>Astronomer.</b>&mdash;A star-gazer. A horse that carries his head high-up in the
air.</p>

<p><b>At Fault.</b>&mdash;At a loss; not knowing in what direction to proceed, like dogs
who have lost scent of a hare or fox. This sporting phrase is often used,
figuratively to signify that a man has been defeated in his pursuits, and
does not know how to extricate himself from difficulty.</p>

<p><b>At Home.</b>&mdash;To <i>Provincials</i>, this phrase may operate rather as a sort of
paradox&mdash;as houses and persons, in general are robbed not “at home” but
when the parties are <i>abroad</i>.</p>

<p><b>Awake.</b>&mdash;Knowing; acquainted with, aware of, or knowing what is going on.
<i>Awake to the move</i>, aware of the proceedings; <i>Stow the books, the culls
are awake</i>, Hide the cards, the persons know what we intend to do. This
word is used on many occasions, and in most situations of life, being
expressive of attention.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="large">B.</span></p>

<p><b>Babes in the Wood.</b>&mdash;Persons confined in the stocks or pillory, said also
of dice.</p>

<p><b>Babes of Grace.</b>&mdash;Puritanical, sanctified-looking persons; also drunken
psalm-smiting cobblers.</p>

<p><b>Back-slums.</b>&mdash;Beggars’ meeting places; Dyot Street, St. Giles’; Kent
Street, in the Borough, &amp;c. The expression applies to all Metropolitan
receptacles of mendicants, prostitutes, thieves, and rogues of every
degree to get a night’s lodging. <i>Back Slummers</i>, dirty, common, low, and
vagrant people who reside in the <i>Back-slums</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bag the Swag.</b>&mdash;Pocket, or put into a bag, the plunder, or hide the stolen
property.</p>

<p><b>Baked.</b>&mdash;Done up, exhausted, tired out, “<i>When I got to the top of the
hill</i> I was regularly&mdash;<i>Baked</i>!”&mdash;<i>Soft-baked</i> in also employed to persons
who lack worldly wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><b>Baker, Charles.</b>&mdash;Comedian, died November 26, 1844.</p>

<p><b>Bang-up.</b>&mdash;Quite right, the thing! the go! done complete, in handsome
style, quite fashionable, at the top of the <i>mode</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bank.</b>&mdash;A snug and secure place to deposit plunder; <i>Bank the rag</i>, to take
care of money.</p>

<p><b>Barbers’ Clerks.</b>&mdash;Shopmen, and poor ill-paid and half-starved apprentices,
or conceited ignorant shop-boys.</p>

<p><b>Barking Irons.</b>&mdash;Pistols, from the explosions being supposed to resemble
the barking of a dog.</p>

<p><b>Baron Nab’em.</b>&mdash;Otherwise <span class="smcap">Nicholas Borrowbody</span>. The individual bearing this
name who <i>devotes his attentions</i> to Logic, in his <i>moments of
retirement</i>, is Mr. James Soares, more familiarly termed <i>Jemmy Soares</i>;
well-known in the sporting world, particularly among the friends and
supporters of the <i>Ring</i>, and long the <i>President of the Daffy Club</i>, a
society held at Belcher’s, the Castle Tavern, Holborn. Events have
occurred to prevent his occupying so prominent a place, as formerly, in
the list of milling amateurs: but his open heartedness, his native humour,
his liberal temper, and convivial disposition, will long be remembered
with pleasure, by the numerous pals, who were wont to surround him.</p>

<p><b>Barrymore, W.</b>&mdash;Comedian, died in America, November 24, 1846.</p>

<p><b>Baxter’s Hats.</b>&mdash;A celebrated <i>Topper-maker</i> to the <i>Fancy</i>. Formerly in
high repute with the amateurs, in respect to giving the <i>knowledge-box</i> an
important <i>look</i>!</p>

<p><b>Beaks.</b>&mdash;Justices, from their former cormorantish qualities&mdash;“Your
<i>vulture</i> hath a devil of a <i>beak</i>!” But things are different. The
Magistrates of the present day, that is the Metropolitan ones, are, with
some few exceptions an honour to the Bench. <i>Beaksmen</i>, constables, or
police officers.</p>

<p><b>Beat.</b>&mdash;A watchman’s walk, the district in which he is licensed to <i>beat</i>
at will all Her Majesty’s peaceable and loving subjects.</p>

<p><b>Beaver.</b>&mdash;A hat; probably from generally possessing very little <i>beaver</i>.
My last <i>beaver</i> turned out to be all <i>silk</i>, as Jack Bannister said, “The
loss was felt”:&mdash;I cleft his <i>beaver</i> with a downright
blow.&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Beeswax.</b>&mdash;Cheese, generally Gloucester, from the similarity between
them&mdash;“Lets have a twopenny burster, half a quartern o’ <i>beesvax</i>, an
ha’p’oth o’ ingens, and a dollop o’ salt along vith it, vill you?”&mdash;<i>Dusty
Bob.</i></p>

<p><b>Beggars.</b>&mdash;Our street beggars have existed from time immemorial; their
profession had become, in some measure, sanctioned by long tolerance. They
were a merry, ingenious, persevering, and almost innoxious race. They are
associated with our earliest recollections; like <i>Springlove</i> in <span class="smcap">Brome’s</span>
healthful and truly old English opera, “<i>The Jovial Crew!</i>” we at certain
seasons feel almost a yearning to join them. Their wild free life, their
careless revelry, present charms to us in retrospection, to which we are
not wholly proof!&mdash;we think upon the “<i>Beggar’s Bush</i>” of those twin stars
<span class="smcap">Beaumont</span> and <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>. Classic recollections bring <span class="smcap">Belisarius</span> with his
“<i>Date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> Obolum</i>” to our mind.
<span class="smcap">Bamfylde Moore Carew</span>; Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Montford</span>,
<i>The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>; King <span class="smcap">Cophueta</span>, who loved the <i>Beggar
Maid</i>, the valiant <i>beggar</i> who beat the redoubted <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> to a
standstill are among the most favourite heroes of our childhood. The race
whose cause we are attempting to advocate, had at least the claim of
destitution on our attention; as Lubin Log has it, our bounty was at all
events “<i>hobtional</i>.” But what shall we say of the wealthy and the great,
who have become beggars upon the <i>public purse</i> for the purpose of putting
these their now persecuted rivals down? They have no claim, no
excuse&mdash;away with them&mdash;shame on such monopoly!</p>

<p><b>Beggar’s Opera.</b>&mdash;There were two public-houses in Church Lane, St. Giles’s;
chiefly supported by beggars, one, called the Beggar’s Opera, which was
the Rose and Crown, and the other the Robin Hood&mdash;at both of which Noah
Ark Societies&mdash;that is “<i>Motley-Crew</i> Societies”&mdash;were held. The number
that frequented these houses at various times, was computed to be from two
to three hundred, and the receipts at a moderate calculation could not be
less than from three to five shillings a day each person, frequently more.</p>

<p><b>Bellamy, William.</b>&mdash;Bass Singer, died January 3, 1843, aged 74.</p>

<p><b>Belcher.</b>&mdash;A large red neckerchief spotted with yellow and black, and first
worn by Jem Belcher the famous pugilist, 1781-1811. “The <i>Kiddy</i> flashes
his <i>Belcher</i>.” Tom Belcher’s colour was yellow, with white and black

August, 1824. On Sunday, November 4, 1827, it was publicly announced
that&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Pierce Egan’s Life in London and Sporting Guide</span>” is this day
incorporated with “<span class="smcap">Bell’s Life in London</span>.” All communications for the
Editor, therefore, are requested to be transmitted, in future, to the
Office, No. 169, Strand.... Let it not be forgotten, that “<span class="smcap">Bell’s Life in

the Kingdom. “Compare and Judge.” <span class="large">☞</span> “The Price is but
Sevenpence.”&mdash;“Mr. Vincent Dowling, the Editor, was well known in the
Sporting World and in him the <i>Fancy</i> found a sincere friend. He is a most
excellent companion; cheerful, witty, and satirical at all times, but, in
the latter display of his talents, the <i>feather</i> appears more than the
razor&mdash;he tickles his adversaries, rather than wounds their
feelings”&mdash;<i>Pierce Egan.</i>&mdash;A service of plate value 100 gs. was presented
to Mr. Vincent Dowling, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, July 18, 1833.</p>

Labour,” as political economists term it, is particularly attended to in
the London School of <i>gonnofs</i>, not only for the sake of convenience, but
from the well-known principle that “<i>Practice makes perfect</i>.”
Accordingly, it would be considered as untradesman-like for a <i>Billy

the late Colonel Thornton’s Lady and Mr. Flint,” and reported by him in
“<span class="smcap">Book of Sport</span>,” thus graphically describes the <i>Broad Fencer</i> of the
period:&mdash;“The <i>Cads</i>, and fellows with the Race Lists, were thus <i>hawking</i>
their bills and cards over the race ground to obtain purchasers. Come my
worthy sporting gentlemen from all parts of the kingdom&mdash;now’s your time
to open your eyes and look about you, when you will see to-day what you
never saw before in your life, and, perhaps, you may never see again, if
you live as long as Old Methuselah. Come, I say, who’s for a list&mdash;the
whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> list, and nothing else but a true list&mdash;besides, you will have a
correct and particlar account of the terrible, terrible, terrible
high-bred female&mdash;the good-lady of Colonel Thornton; there is nothing like
her in the universal world. Old Astley’s troupe are mere <i>patches</i> upon
her managing a horse, she will this day ride a match like a lady, over the
four mile course for 500 guineas, and 1000 guineas bye; and some hundreds
of thousands are likewise depending upon this most extraordinary match
between the “<i>Jockey in Petticoats</i>” against the well-known sporting
character Mr. Flint, in his “<i>doe skins and top boots</i>;” and looked upon
as one of the best gentlemen riders in the nation. You have also the names
of the horses, and the colours of the riders, with every other particular
that can enlighten your minds, and make you gentlemen sportsmen acquainted
with this lively race. You have now the opportunity to lay out your money
according to your inclination. The gentleman allows the lady to ride what
weight she likes, there being a mutual understanding between them upon the
subject; therefore, she will not, like commoners go “<i>to scale</i>” as she
will not be <i>handled</i> by any body before she starts for the prize; indeed,
the Female Jockey is not considered any <i>weight</i> at all. Her importance
and self-possession are the only objects for consideration. What does
spirit, fire, blood, and gaiety weigh, I should like to ask? I answer
nothing,&mdash;my masters! Such high bred qualities are as light as air&mdash;brisk
as the wind&mdash;and 2 to 1 towards winning. You have also at the same price,
the plain and simple pedigree of the female Jockey. Her “<i>sire</i>” was a
capital “good un;” her <i>dam</i>, a prime fleet “un,” an Eclipse in character;
her <i>brother</i>, all that could be wished upon the turf, for getting over
the ground like a sky rocket, her <i>sister</i>, a Nonpareil at all points, and
above any price, but her owner, her out-and-out owner, the Colonel from
his “upper crust” down to his “walker,” is a match for all England against
any thing&mdash;for every thing alive&mdash;either on the turf or turnpike,&mdash;from a
mouse to an elephant: and nothing else but winning belongs to his stable.
And lastly, though not the least in the above Catalogue of
Excellence,&mdash;every <i>point</i> of the Female Jockey is tip-top, her agility is
captivating; and she mounts her <i>prad</i> like the most accomplished horseman
in the world. Her movements defy expression; her nods to the females, as
she rides over the Course, delightful! but her smiles to the applauding
gentlemen, in answer to the winks, bows, and other marks of politeness
towards her, as compliments for her daring exploits, are fascinating,
elegant, and nothing else but winning. She is seated upon her high-bred
animal with all the firmness of a <i>Nimrod</i>; she holds her reins with the
most perfect ease and style; and Chifney, in the best of his days, never
displayed a better knowledge of horsemanship than the Female Jockey, and
she flourishes her whip with all the good taste of the leader of a band at
a concert. In fact, she is a <i>Nonesuch!</i> a <span class="smcap">Paragon!!</span> a PHENOMENON!!! Her
<i>prad</i> too, <i>Old Vingarillo</i>, is also a picture of <i>goodness</i>, from his
<i>peepers</i> down to his <i>fetlocks</i>! Therefore, my worthy sportsmen, do not
lose this opportunity&mdash;be not too late&mdash;but purchase this great
curiosity&mdash;this <i>List</i> of <i>lists</i>&mdash;nothing like it having occurred in
Yorkshire, or, in any other part of the globe since Noah’s flood&mdash;either
before or since the wet season of the year; and it is <i>York Minster</i> to a
<i>brass farden</i> that nothing like it can occur again till we have a new
generation of the human race? <i>That’s a fact!!!</i>”</p>

<p><b>Buffs&mdash;Buffaloes&mdash;and Buffaloism.</b>&mdash;A society held at the Harp Tavern in
Great Russell Street, opposite Drury Lane Theatre, and was first
established in August, 1822, by an eccentric young man of the name of
Joseph Lisle, an artist, in conjunction with Mr. W. Sinnett, a comedian,
to perpetuate, according to their ideas upon the subject, of that hitherto
neglected ballad of “<i>We’ll chase the</i> <span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>!” The society is composed
of numerous Performers, and other “comical wights” resident in the
metropolis. The ceremony of making a <span class="smcap">Buffalo</span> is very simple, yet extremely
ludicrous, and productive of great laughter. At first the person intended
to become a <span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, is seated on a chair in the middle of the room, with
a bandage placed over his eyes. The initiated <span class="smcap">Buffaloes</span> are waiting
outside of the door: the orator being decorated with a wig, &amp;c., for the
occasion. On a given signal, they all enter the room, with what they term
the Kangaroo Leap, and jump round the chair of the “<span class="smcap">Degraded wretch</span>,”&mdash;as
the victim is termed. This is succeeded by a solemn march, and the
following <i>chaunt</i>; the <span class="smcap">Buffaloes</span> carrying brooms, shovels, mops, and a
large kettle by way of a kettledrum:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Bloody-head and raw-bones!<br />
Bloody-head and raw-bones!<br />
Be not perplexed,<br />
This is the text.<br />
Bloody-head and raw-bones!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcaplc">CHARGE</span> is then given to the “<i>victim</i>” by the <i>Primo Buffo</i>,
accompanied by the most extravagant and ridiculous gestures:&mdash;</p>

<p>“DEGRADED WRETCH!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miserable Ashantee!!</span>&mdash;<i>Unfortunate individual!!!</i>&mdash;At
least you were so, not a quarter of an hour since. You are now entitled to
divers privileges: you may <i>masticate</i>, denticate, chump, grind, swallow,
and devour, in all turnip fields, meadows, and pastures; and moreover, you
have the especial privilege of grazing in Hyde Park;&mdash;Think of that my
<span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>! You may also drink at all the lakes, rivers, canals, and ponds;
not forgetting the Fleet and lower ditches. You are entitled to partake of
all public dinners,&mdash;upon your paying for the same&mdash;such are a few of the
advantages you will enjoy! but you must promise to <i>gore</i> and <i>toss</i> all
enemies to <span class="smcap">Buffaloism</span>! You must likewise promise to patronise the <i>Horns</i>,
at Kennington; and occasionally visit <i>Horn</i>-sey Wood, where you may do
what you like best&mdash;<i>rusticate</i>, <i>cogitate</i>, or <i>illustrate</i>, and prove
yourself an <i>Horn</i>-ament by respecting the natives of the island of
<span class="smcap">Goree-he</span>!”</p>

<p>The bandage is then removed from the eyes&mdash;and the chorus of “<i>Chase the
Buffalo</i>,” is repeated. The <i>victim</i> is then led into the passage, and
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> signs, &amp;c., are given to him, after which he is ushered into the room
with the full chorus of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">See! the conquering hero comes,<br />
Sound the trumpet, beat the drums,<br />
Sports prepare, the laurels bring,<br />
Songs of triumph to him sing.</p>

<p>He is then called on for the accustomary fees for liquor, and a small
compliment for the <i>Buffalo</i> in waiting: the expenses are in proportion to
the means, or inclination of the newly-made member. The liquor is
introduced by the chorus altered from the Pirates:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“We Buffaloes lead a jolly, jolly life, Fal de, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>A blessing is then given by the <i>Primo Buffo</i>, reminding the new member
that the greatest characters in the country have solicited to become
<span class="smcap">Buffaloes</span>, and the following is sung in solemn style.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="smcap">Harponians</span> list unto me,<br />

<p><b>Castle Tavern.</b>&mdash;<i>The Castle Tavern, Holborn</i>, was first opened as a
Sporting House by the well-known <span class="smcap">Bob Gregson</span>; but designated at that
period under the familiar title of <span class="smcap">Bob’s Chop House</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">His house is known to all the <i>milling</i> train;<br />
He gives them liquor, and relieves their pain.</p>

<p>The appearance of Bob Gregson was prepossessing&mdash;he was in height six feet
one inch and a half, weighing about fifteen stone six pounds. It is rather
singular to relate that Bob Gregson rose in the estimation of the Sporting
World, from defeat, he fought only three battles in the P.R., and lost
them all&mdash;thus, beaten by John Gulley, 200 gns., 36 rds., near Newmarket,
Oct. 14, 1807. Again beaten by John Gulley, 200 gns., 75 mins., 28 rds.,
May 10, 1808. Beaten by Tom Cribb, 500 gns., 23 rds., Moulsey Hurst, Oct.
25, 1808. The sun for a long time shone brilliantly over the “Temple of
the Fancy,” but poor Bob, like too many of his class, did not make hay
while it was in his power; when the scene changed, the clouds of
misfortune overwhelmed him; and the once sprightly, gay Lancashire hero
was compelled to beat an inglorious retreat. The stylish, well-conducted
<span class="smcap">Tom Belcher</span>, next appeared in the character of landlord of the Castle. The
house had undergone some repairs, the rooms were all retouched by the
painter; elegance with cleanliness, backed by civility, became the order
of the day; a prime stock of liquors and wines were also laid in to
command the attendance of the public. <i>Tom’s</i> opening dinner was
completely successful, and the <i>Fancy</i> rallied round a hero who had so
nobly contended for victory in thirteen prize battles. Tom was also
considered the most accomplished boxer of the day; and the remembrance,
likewise, that he was the brother of the renowned Jem Belcher, were
<i>points</i> in themselves of great attractions in the Sporting World; and the
above Tavern again became one of the most favourite resorts of the <i>Fancy</i>
in general. Tom Belcher, after fourteen years residence at the Castle, was
enabled by his civil conduct, attention to business, good luck, and a good
quantity of the “<i>Sweeteners of Life</i>” with <span class="smcap">Bank!</span> security against a rainy
day, he retired to a very handsome cottage on Finchley Common, living at
his ease like a man of fortune, with his dog and his gun. <span class="smcap">Tom
Spring</span>&mdash;Champion of England&mdash;next appeared in the character of “Mine Host”
at the Castle Tavern. “His appearance” said Pierce Egan&mdash;“is very much in
his favour; and there is a manly dignity about his person which is
prepossessing, his language is also mild and perfectly correct; and his
behavour at all times truly civil and attentive to his customers.” A night
spent at Tom Spring’s may not be regretted by the most <i>fastidious</i>
visitor. If the <i>ears</i> cannot at all times be gratified with the various
topics of argument brought forward; the <i>eyes</i> have no cause for
complaint, the coffee room and every part of it is covered over with some
attractive device, and if there are not so many pictures for criticism as
may be seen at the <span class="smcap">Exhibition</span>, there are a number of most excellent
sporting subjects well worthy the attention of the observer. One of the
most prominent amongst them for a display of talent is a “Picture of the
Road going to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> Fight” drawn and etched from life by Robert Criukshank,
Esq., but often attributed to his brother, George Cruikshank. As this is
not the fact, and as the opportunity occurs we hasten to set the matter
right, in order that every <i>tub</i> may stand upon its own bottom, or, in
other words, that the saddle may be put on the right horse. Soon after the
above “<i>Picture of the Road to the Fight</i>” was hung up at the Castle
Tavern, I met there one evening my two friends, Mr. Hone (the very clever
editor of the ‘Every Day Book’ and several other publications of merit)
and Mr. George Cruikshank. On looking at the picture, Mr. Hone said to me,
after praising it to the skies, “George has out-done himself!” “No,” I
replied, “you mean Bob Cruikshank.” “Indeed, I do not,” answered Mr. H.,
“I repeat, that George has out-done himself; and more clever touches of
art I never saw&mdash;they are beautiful!” “Well,” said I, “if you are so
positive, Mr. Hone, I will bet you anything you like, from a glass of grog
to a five pound note, that Bob Cruikshank accompanied myself down the Road
to Moulsey Hurst, to accomplish the above picture.” Upon Mr. Hone
appealing to George Cruikshank on the subject, the latter celebrated
artist, without the least hesitation, answered, “<i>I had no hand in it</i>.”
After this declaration, Mr. Hone did not attempt to retract the
compliments he had paid to the merits of the picture in question; but, of
course, they now operated with double effect on the talents of Mr. Robert
Cruikshank. In conclusion, I have only to observe that the Castle Tavern
is open at all times to the visitor, either to confute my representation
of it, or to verify the truth of my assertion&mdash;but of this circumstance I
feel strongly assured that an evening spent at the above sporting house
will never prove a source of regret to the stranger who is anxious to
witness some of the peculiarities of “<span class="smcap">Life in London</span>.”</p>

was struck with astonishment at the surrounding group. “It is nothing new
to me,” replied <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, “but rather a renewed feature of low Life in
London. But we will ask the waiter for some little account about the
chairman, who appears to me to be an original; and we must also obtain, if
possible, a trifling outline of his assistant, the <i>Lady Patroness</i> of
this meeting. The chairman in petticoats.”</p>

<p>“They are both <i>out-and-outers</i>,” answered the waiter, “and nothing like
them on earth to keep such an unruly company together, as ‘<i>Any-thing</i>
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span>’ and ‘<i>Half-quartern</i> <span class="smcap">Luce</span>!’ The chairman <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, has been, by turns,
a costard-monger, a coal-whipper, a flying dustman, a boner of

honest penny, and a bit of a prig, if it suited him, sooner than have to
complain of an empty <i>Victualling-Office</i>. He can throw off a flash

<p>“As to <i>Half-quartern</i> <span class="smcap">Luce</span>,” continued the waiter, “she’s a clever woman,
in fact, she was reared a real lady, but now she is scarcely ever sober. I
have known her to drink thirty-six half-quarterns of gin in a day; it is
from her love of <i>blue ruin</i> she derives her name. <span class="smcap">Luce</span> was once a very
handsome woman, but she has been reduced, step by step, to the wretched
creature she now appears to be, and drinks herself stupid to drown all
reflections.”</p>

<p>“I have witnessed a great variety of scenes, since I have been in London,”
said <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> to <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, “but this is equal to any, if it does not <i>beggar</i>

Formality does not belong to this Institution; it has no written rules to
bind its members; no specified time of meeting; no fines for
non-attendance; but the corner-stone is “<span class="smcap">To do what is right</span>.”&mdash;The only
<i>definition</i> I can give to the term “<span class="smcap">Daffy</span>” is that the phrase was coined
at the <i>Mint</i> of <i>Fancy</i>, and has since passed <i>current</i> without being
overhauled as <i>queer</i>. The <i>squeamish</i> Fair One who takes the <span class="smcap">Daffy</span>
regularly on the <i>sly</i> merely to cure the <i>vapours</i>, politely names it to
her friends as “<i>White Wine</i>.” The <i>Swell chaffs</i> it as “<i>Blue Ruin</i>” to
elevate his notions. The <i>Laundress</i> loves dearly a drain of “<i>Ould Tom</i>,”
from its strength to <i>comfort</i> her inside. The <i>drag Fiddler</i> can <i>toss
off</i> a quartern of “<i>Max</i>” without making a wry mug. The <i>Coster Monger</i>
illumines his ideas with “<i>a flash of lightning</i>.” The <i>hoarse Cyprian</i>
owes her existence to copious draughts of “<i>Jacky</i>.” The <i>Link Boy</i> and
<i>Mud Larks</i>, in joining their <i>browns</i> together, are for some “<i>Stark
Naked</i>.” And the <i>Out and Outers</i>, from the addition of <i>bitters</i> to it in
order to sharpen up a dissipated and damaged <i>Victualling Office</i>, cannot
take any thing but “<i>Fuller’s Earth</i>.” Much it should seem, therefore,
depends upon a name; and as a soft sound is at all times pleasing to the
<i>listener</i>&mdash;to have denominated the Sporting Society the “GIN CLUB,” would
not only have proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> barbarous to the ear, but the vulgarity of the
<i>chaunt</i> might have deprived it of many of its elegant friends. It is a
subject, however, which must be admitted has a good deal of <i>Taste</i>
belonging to it&mdash;and as a Sporting Man would be <i>nothing</i> if he was not

<p><b>Flat</b> <i>cum</i> <b>Sharp:</b> <i>par nobile fratrum</i>.&mdash;There is not a word in cant or
flash vocabulary, nor, in the English language, taken in its right sense
and meaning, that conveys so much, and is so generally applicable, as the
simple monosyllable <span class="smcap">Flat</span>. There are <i>flats</i> of every rank, grade, and
station in society, in every part of the known world&mdash;and possibly in the
unexplored portion also. There are <i>flats</i> alike in office and out; in the
senate house and in the cottage&mdash;from the councillor of state to the omega
of legislators, parochial vestrymen! Oh, most comprehensive patronymic!
<span class="smcap">Sharp</span> is also a good term; but only a cipher, in numerical strength of
application, when compared with <i>flat</i>. Flat is an independent, honest,
and respectable word. Sharp is diametrically opposite; it owes its very
birth to <i>flat</i>, and cannot live without it. <i>Flat</i> is the parent;
progenitor, and preserver of <i>sharp</i>, the very root and sap of its
existence. Without flats sharps would become extinct. The fact of <i>sharp</i>
having sprung from <i>flat</i> is so apparent, that there is not a <i>sharp</i> to
be found that has not a <i>flat</i> about him; there consanguinity, therefore,
is undoubted.</p>

<p>Such is human nature, that three parts of the vast universe is peopled
with <i>flats</i>; while the circumscribed and degenerated race of <i>sharps</i> do
not occupy more than a quarter or one fourth of the space. Another proof
may be adduced of the independence of the <i>flats</i>, and that is that they
can live, flourish, and prosper much better without the company of
<i>sharps</i> than with it. Not so with the <i>sharps</i>. They cannot herd and feed
together without first getting the means from the substance and resources
of the <i>flats</i>. We think we have satisfactorily proved to every
dispassionate, disinterested individual, that <i>sharps</i> are entirely
dependent upon their fathers and forefathers, the <i>flats!</i> and there can
be very little doubt but that they are both ungrateful and undutiful to
the parents who have, as we have shown, given them being, succour, the
means of existence.</p>

<p>If a <i>sharp</i> happens to reside in the neighbourhood of a <i>flat</i>, he will
always be found setting his wits to work to relieve him of his property
and earnings, even though the <i>sharp</i> have plenty, and the flat but
little. Such is the undutiful <i>penchant</i> of the <i>sharp</i> for the goods and
chattels of his progenitor the flat!</p>

<p>In this good city, not inappropriately denominated the world’s metropolis,
<i>flats</i> and <i>sharps</i> are plentiful, and may be found located together in
every street and alley. Although the <i>flats</i> have the advantage
numerically, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> are the ingenuity and plausible tactics of the
<i>sharps</i>, that they compel the <i>flats</i> to work to support them. The
<i>sharps</i>, though industrious at scheming, always profess, as their creed,
a profound and rooted contempt for manual labour. Sharps are not found
among gravel-diggers or stone-breakers; we may go further&mdash;seldom amongst
artisans or mechanics of any description. No, they are men whose exalted
minds soar far above the ordinary pursuits even of middle life. The army
boasts of them in abundance. The navy may be said to be composed of
<i>flats</i>, with scarcely one exception. The attachment of the <i>sharps</i> to
the red-coat service of their country is clearly demonstrated by the fact
of the <i>élite</i> of their class conferring military titles on themselves,
without troubling the formal publicity of the <i>Gazette</i>! We may safely
venture to assert, that there is not an army of any nation that can boast
of the number of staff-officers that adorn the lists of our royal corps of
London <i>malleteers</i>, otherwise gentlemen sharps. They resemble our
disbanded militia, only the staff preserved. It is said and sung that “One
half the world does not know how the other half lives&mdash;or dies.” How true
is that oft-used aphorism? What quiet, respectable, church-going citizen
would believe that, early as he rises to give his best care to the
legitimate commerce of his enterprise, there are many traders in the
illegitimate mercantile world who are wide awake, and in full pursuit of
their customers long before his drowsy eyes are open to the
brightly-shining sun; long before the aforesaid shining sun has superseded
the gas-light radiance shed over the populous city of London:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Hyde Park.</b>&mdash;London, W., was the ancient manor of Hyde, belonging to the
Abbey of Westminster, became Crown property at the dissolution 1539. It
was sold by parliament in 1652, but was resumed by the King at the
restoration in 1661. The Serpentine was formed 1730-33. “My dear <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,”
said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, “<span class="smcap">Hyde Park</span> is in my opinion, one of the most delightful scenes
in the world. Indeed it is a fine picture of the English people. It is in
this Park, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, that the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> may be seen dressed as plain as the most
humble individual in the kingdom; the <i>Tradesman</i> more stylish in his
apparel than his <span class="smcap">Lordship</span>; and the <i>Shopman</i> with as fine clothes on his
person as a <span class="smcap">Duke</span>. The <span class="smcap">Countess</span> not half so much ‘bedizened’ over as her
own <i>Waiting-Maid</i>; the <i>Apprentice-Boy</i> as sprucely <i>set-off</i> as a young
sprig of <span class="smcap">Nobility</span>; while the <i>Milliner’s Lass</i> in finery excels the
<span class="smcap">Duchess</span>. But the air of independence which each person seems to breathe
renders the <i>tout ensemble</i> captivating.”</p>

<p>“Observe those prime <i>bits of blood</i>,” from the choicest studs in the
kingdom, prancing about as proud as peacocks, and almost unmanageable to
their dashing riders. The <i>Goldfinches</i> of the day trying to excel each
other in point of coachmanship, turning their vehicles rapidly&mdash;almost to
the eighteenth part of an inch, each priding himself in having obtained
the character for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
displaying the most elegant “<i>set-out</i>.” The <span class="smcap">Man of Ton</span>
<i>staring</i> some modest female, that attracts his attention, completely out
of countenance; while the <i>Lady of Rank</i>, equally <i>delicate</i> in her ideas
of propriety, uses her <i>glass</i> upon the same object till her carriage
removes her out of sight. The <span class="smcap">Debauchee</span>, endeavouring to renovate or brace
himself up with the fine air of the Park, <i>ogling</i> all the girls that
cross his path. The <span class="smcap">Swell Dandy</span> could not exist if he did not show himself
in the Park on a Sunday. The <span class="smcap">Gambler</span> on the <i>look-out</i> to see if any new
pigeon appears in the circle, in order to plan future operations that may
turn out to his advantage. The <i>peep o’-day</i> <span class="smcap">Woman</span> <i>of Quality</i>, who,
night after night, disposes of all her hours of rest in card-parties and
routs, is here to be seen riding down the circle to <i>chit-chat</i> and nod to
her friends, in order to get rid of her yawnings, and to appear something
like being <i>awake</i> at dinner-time. The <span class="smcap">Peer</span>, relaxing from his
parliamentary duties, and the Members of the Lower House here take a ride
among the various parties in the circle, to hear their conduct and
measures descanted upon, and likewise to “pick-up” a little information
respecting the buz on public affairs. The scheming <i>Procuress</i> sporting
some new-caught lady-birds in a splendid carriage, in order to excite
attention and to distribute her <i>cards</i> with more effect. The wealthy <span class="smcap">Cit</span>,
whose <i>plum</i> has rendered him <i>sweet</i> amongst his grand next-door
neighbours at the West-end of the town, here shows himself with all the
confidence derived from a splendid fortune. The extravagant <i>Fancy-Lady</i>,
making use of the thousand little arts that she is mistress of, trying to
take the <i>shine</i> out of all the other females in the circle, merely to
show the <i>taste</i> and liberality of her <i>keeper</i>. The <i>flashy Tradesman</i>,
who laughs at the vulgar prejudices of old sayings and propriety about
“Keeping your shop and it will keep you,” here pushes along in his <i>natty</i>
gig and prime trotter, and appears upon as “good terms” with himself as
the richest banker in London, laughing in his sleeve at the idea, that, if
anything goes wrong from his stylish-pursuits, a temporary absence from
his friends, united with the aid of <i>white-washing</i>, will soon make him
“all right again.”</p>

<p>It is equally interesting and attractive, from the numerous characters of
both sexes, <i>ogling</i> each other, as they frequently come in contact. The
<i>Tailor</i> confined to his shop-board all the week, enjoys the double
advantage of gaining a little fresh air in the Park, as well as admiring
some of his own performances on the backs of many of the dashing crowd;
and the <i>Milliner</i>, also upon the same errand, not only to improve her
health, but to retain in her eye the newest fashion sported in this
hemisphere of the <span class="smcap">Great</span>. The pleasure, too, of being known and recognized
by your friends and acquaintances. The numerous bows and friendly How d’ye
do’s? With that admired sort of <span class="smcap">Life in London</span>, all jostling against each
other in the Park with the utmost <i>sang-froid</i>. The <span class="smcap">Nobleman</span> and the
<i>Yokel</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Divine</span> and the “<i>Family-man</i>”&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Player</span> and the <i>Poet</i>&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Impure</span> and the <i>Modest-girl</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Grave</span> and the <i>Gay</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Flash Cove</span> and
the <i>Man of Sentiment</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Flat</span> and the <i>Sharp</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Dandy</span> and the
<i>Gentleman</i>&mdash;the out-and-out <span class="smcap">Swell</span> and the <i>Groom</i>&mdash;the real <span class="smcap">Sportsman</span> and
the <i>Black-Leg</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Heavy Toddlers</span> and the <i>Operators</i>&mdash;the dashing <span class="smcap">Bum
Trap</span> and the <i>Shy Cove</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Marchioness</span> and her <i>Cook</i>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Duke</span> and the

his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> “<i>Rainbow</i>”&mdash;the
<i>Whitechapel</i> <span class="smcap">Knight of the Cleaver</span> and his fat

the smiling eye of his <i>Mistress</i>&mdash;the young <span class="smcap">Blood</span> in search of adventures
and to make assignations.</p>

<p>It ought, however, not to be forgotten, that every thing which is lovely,
interesting, honourable, virtuous, generous, feeling, witty, elegant, and
humane, which tends so much to give the English females a proud
superiority over those of most other nations, is here to be met with in a
transcendant degree; and it should also be remembered, that every thing
which is designing, crafty, plausible, imposing, insinuating, and
deluding, is likewise to be run against in these gay paths of pleasure.

<p><b>Kean.</b>&mdash;“<i>Hear</i> <span class="smcap">Kean</span> <i>speak</i>.” Edmund Kean, the celebrated tragedian,
1787-1833.</p>

<p><b>Kean’s Head&mdash;The.</b>&mdash;Was a well-known theatrical tavern in Russell Court,
Drury Lane. It had previously been called the O.P. and P.S. but
re-christened in <i>honour!</i> to the celebrated tragedian&mdash;then in the zenith
of his fame, the late Edmund Kean:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Then off again, no fear or dread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the once famed O.P.</span><br />
In better taste&mdash;chang’d to <span class="smcap">Kean’s Head</span>&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And noted for a <i>spree</i>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Pierce Egan’s <i>The Show Folks</i>.</span></p>

<p>The tavern was much frequented by all persons directly and indirectly
connected with the theatrical profession. And was at one time kept by Tom
Hudson, a jolly <i>bon vivant</i>, and famous comic song writer and singer, of
whom Pierce Egan, wrote&mdash;“his facility in producing songs is
astonishing&mdash;he also sings them with a peculiar <i>naiveté</i>, and tells his
‘story’ to his company better than most men, who are not regular
performers. In his line, he is a second Charles Dibdin, senr.&mdash;The above
tavern,” continues Pierce Egan&mdash;“afforded considerable amusement to its
visitors, as a few wags, fond of a bit of fun, frequented the coffee-room
every evening, and, in concert together, represented themselves as
managers from the country, in want of performers, and waiting in turn to
engage young men for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> different ‘<i>lines of business</i>,’ to complete their
companies. This had the desired effect; and numerous ludicrous scenes was
the result, which defy anything like communication, and enthusiastic,
stage-struck, inexperienced youths afforded these <i>pretended</i> managers
sport and roars of laughter, night after night. The plan generally adopted
was, that one of the party kept on the look out to pick up a simple
youth&mdash;having a soul above buttons!&mdash;and having got one in tow, he was
formally introduced to the assumed proprietor of a country theatre. The
latter person, with a face of gravity, then inquired whether he wished to
engage for the <i>light</i> or <i>heavy</i> business of the stage, or if singing was
his forte; or, perhaps, he could undertake the general line, and assist in
melo-dramas, spectacles, &amp;c., &amp;c. The manager then, with a polite request,
wished to have a ‘taste’ of the young man’s quality, before he finally
settled his engagement, and fixed his salary. And several young aspiring
heroes, anxious to obtain an engagement, have been prevailed upon to mount
the table, and to give selections from Romeo, Hamlet, and Octavian, &amp;c.,
amidst the shouts of <i>pretended</i> applause from country actors, wags of all
sorts, and men of the world, who nightly resorted to this tavern, to pick
up anecdotes, and spend a pleasant hour. When the managers! thought they
had had enough of this burlesque, ‘the <i>exit</i>&mdash;the <i>exit</i>,’ would be
whispered one to another, and while the hero on the table was spouting out
some impassioned speech from Shakespeare, his back would be readily
assailed with the contents of their jugs; and upon the unfortunate wight
hastily looking round for the authors of such an assault, his front, from
another part of the company, would be attacked in the same manner. Redress
was out of the question, and the more passion and rage exhibited by the
youth, produced the more laughter; when he was informed it was the way to
teach him how to make his ‘<i>exit</i>’ in a rage! and that no person would
deny him the title of being a <i>wet</i> actor. It was Tom Hudson who altered
the sign of the tavern to the Kean’s Head: a remarkable likeness of the
great tragedian was hung over the fireplace, and he was wont to visit Tom
and take a drink after the fatigue of the night’s performance. The mere
rumour of this attracted many to the house. A capital harmonic meeting
took place late at night&mdash;or rather early in the morning, which was
supported by a mixture of professionals from the theatres, and amateurs of
talent and celebrity. Vain endeavours were seldom entered upon at Tom
Hudson’s; a pretender was soon coughed down. Amongst the leaders of the
vocal department who contributed to the musical attractions were Morton
Box; Jem Savern; Little Harris; Joe Wells, so popular afterwards in
connection with the Coal Hole; Mr. John Hart, late of the Cider Cellars;
Tom Prynn, Belasco, and others of great vocal talent and celebrity.
<i>Apropos</i> of Edmund Kean, the late Mr. Leman Rede, author and dramatist,
in his ‘Sketch of the Life of John Reeve,’ relates the following
anecdote&mdash;‘Kean’s name was the ‘open sesame’ to all night houses near the
theatres; and ere John Reeve came upon the stage, he was apt to indulge
much in the ‘little hours.’ He and his friends, lads of his own age, could
not have got admission, but he knew the secret, and acted accordingly.
After giving a mystic knock, he applied his mouth to the keyhole, and with
an exactitude of imitation that defied detection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> exclaimed&mdash;‘’Tis
I&mdash;&mdash;Kean&mdash;Edmund Kean!’ In an instant the door was opened; in glided
Reeve, saying, with an easy assurance, ‘Ned’s just gone round the
corner&mdash;back in a moment.’”</p>

carnival in St. Giles’s. He had not been there long when the Chairman, Sir
Jeffery Dunston, addressing the company, and pointing to the then Prince
of Wales, said “I call upon that ’ere gemman with a shirt for a song.” The
Prince, as well as he could, got excused upon his friend promising to sing
for him, and he chaunted in a prime style a flash ballad full of “St.
Giles’s Greek,” for which he received great applause. The Major’s health
having been drunk with nine times nine, and responded to by him, wishing
them “good luck till they were tired of it,” he departed with the Prince
to afford the company time to fix their different routes for the ensuing
day’s business.</p>

<p><b>Mother Emerson’s.</b>&mdash;A night-house situate in the Haymarket, at one time
called the Turk’s Head, but of later times named the Waterford Arms, out
of compliment to the late generous-hearted and frolicsome Marquis of
Waterford, who was a great patron and supporter of the house.</p>

<p>The late&mdash;self-styled&mdash;Lord Chief Baron Nicholson: who was intimately
acquainted with “Mother Emerson,” wrote of her thus.&mdash;“In business Mrs.
Emerson was a wonder. I cannot possibly do better than present a sketch of
her in and out of her trade:&mdash;”</p>

<p class="poem">NIGHT-HOUSES AND THEIR KEEPERS.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Emerson.</span></span><br />
’Twas landlady Meg that made such rare flip;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pull away, pull away, my hearties;</span><br />
At Wapping she lived, at the sign of the Ship,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where tars met in such jolly parties.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><i>Dibdin.</i></span></p>

<p>The famous landlady, Meg of Wapping, might have been very celebrated, and
a very great person, at the time she lived, and at the particular part of
the town she resided in, namely, that <i>Fashionable Watering-Place</i>,
Wapping; but all landladies of the present day are placed in the shade,
totally eclipsed, by that all-accomplished and indefatigable woman of
business, Mrs. Emerson, of the Waterford Arms, late the Turk’s Head,
Haymarket.</p>

<p>Although she is not defunct, she may be properly termed the <i>late</i> Mrs.
Emerson. Night after night she keeps her body up, and her appearance,
every time we see her she seems to look younger and fresher. She is quite
a character in her way, and the best flat-catcher in London. “How d’ye do,
my dear?” is her general salutation to the swells who frequent her
lush-crib. “Well, I thank you, mother,” is the reply. “What’ll you take?”
For it is considered a great honour amongst the flats to get mother to
drink with them. “Oh! Sherry, my son; Sherry for me,” says mother.</p>

<p>“A bottle of sherry here, waiter,” says the flat; and she makes the
favoured few who have the right of <i>entrée</i> behind her bar, pay for the
distinguished indulgence.</p>

<p>The Irishmen say, “Who has e’er had the luck to see Donnybrook Fair?” We
ask, “Who has e’er had the luck to see Mistress Emerson on a race-course?
We have, and a greater out-and-outer we never met&mdash;“Rich and rare were the
gems she wore:”&mdash;and there you may see the gay old gal togged to the
extreme of fashion, with pink silk stockings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> display her well-shaped
understandings&mdash;for we must inform our readers that mother don’t stand
upon trifles&mdash;generally a nice satin shoe and dress; also lots-and-lots of
jewellery, stated to be worth, including <i>thimble</i>, <i>hoops</i>, and
<i>chin-prop</i>, something approaching a cool thousand. It is a great
advantage to single gentlemen <i>wot</i> go to the races to be acquainted with
mother; she always takes a plentiful supply of <i>wittles</i>, and an awful lot
of the sparkling and still&mdash;not the <i>private still</i>; for amongst her
friends and patrons she makes it as public as possible, and when she is
really “standing sam,” as she facetiously calls it, you can’t make more
free than welcome.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we must observe that we do justice to every one, and seek
not to gain popularity by villifying those who are not in a situation to
resent it. In many&mdash;very many instances the public little know&mdash;or care of
whom they speak, and we are all too prone to come to hasty conclusions,
and to speak with prejudice and without inquiry. Now be it known to all
who care to know, that, Mrs. Emerson is really and truly a very
kind-hearted and charitable person, in spite of the very disadvantageous
position she stands in with the public by keeping a night-house. She
strives as much as possible to prevent the ingress of improper characters,
and so far she is successful, for no robbery has ever taken place in her
house since she has been in business.</p>

<p><b>Mother H’s.</b>&mdash;Was a notorious night-house opposite the front entrance of
Drury Lane Theatre, and then the great <i>rendezvous</i> for the gay city
birds, as well as the more fantastic dandies of the West-end. Mother H.,
or Mrs. Hoskins, was the <i>remnant</i> of Mr. Hoskins, who had, in the words
of George Barrington, the pickpocket, <i>par excellence!</i> “Left his country
for his country’s good.” Mother H. is described by a writer who knew her
well as the “ugliest woman I ever beheld; but she dearly loved paint,
dress, and decorations. Her attire was in the highest style of fashion,
generally black velvet or satin, jewellery in profusion, silk stockings,
and very neat kid shoes. She had rather a pretty ankle.” “<i>Apropos</i> of her
shoes, I may remark that the old girl was artful, deceitful, and
dishonest. I remember a half-drunken, foolish fellow dropping a handful of
sovereigns in the large supper-room. A number of the fair and frail were
present; Mother H. said, “Now girls, stand away, I’ll pick them up and see
that the gentleman ain’t robbed;” she should have added, “<i>By any one but
myself</i>,” for about every second sovereign she took from the floor she
“welled” in her shoes. “Well,” said one of the girls; “I don’t blame you
mother, but I should like to stand in your shoes.” Mother H. retired with
an ample fortune. Turned&mdash;as a matter of course, <i>very religious</i>, married
a highly respectable timber merchant at Brighton, who died and left her
money. She again tried her luck in the matrimonial lottery, although
nearly seventy years of age. Her third husband was a serious, calm, tall
and respectable Dissenter, who outlived her.”</p>

<p><b>Mutton Walk.</b>&mdash;The Saloons of Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres&mdash;“Upon
the arrival of <span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> at Drury Lane Theatre, the performances did
not operate on their feelings as a source of attraction. It is true they
took a <i>glimpse</i> at the play, but as they did not go for anything like
<i>criticism</i> on the abilities of the actors, or to descant upon the merits
of the pieces, it was merely a <i>glimpse</i> indeed. Our heroes went upon
another errand. Their eyes were directed to different parts of the house;
and <span class="smcap">Tom</span> not meeting with any of his acquaintances at ‘Old Drury,’ as he
had anticipated, they immediately pushed off to take a peep at Covent
Garden Theatre. A <i>look</i> at the stage was quite sufficient for their
purpose; and without any more delay, the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> soon
<i>bustled</i> into the Saloon.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tom</span> and his Coz, had scarcely reached the place for refreshments, when
the <i>buz</i> began, and they were surrounded by numbers of the gay <i>Cyprians</i>
who nightly visit this place. Some of these <i>delicate</i> heroines, soon
began to jeer the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> on the <i>cause</i> of his absence; while others
of these <i>Lady Birds</i> were offering their congratulations to him on his
restoration to Society. <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> being in company with so distinguished a
hero as <span class="smcap">Tom</span> was of itself a sufficient source of attraction to these
<i>Fancy Pieces</i> to pay their court to <span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>; and, accordingly, their
cards were presented to <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, in order to grace their lists with the
addition of a <i>new</i> and rich <i>Friend</i>. These cards rather puzzled <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,

to conceal the <i>poverty</i> of his circumstances, and having only a few
minutes left before his ticket or <i>Mortgage-deed!</i> expired as to <i>date</i>,
which not being renewed, his property must have been forfeited, turned off
the question, with a smile, observing, “To a place of <i>amusement</i>.” “What

“Excellent! It abounds with incidents; and you cannot depart without

unrivalled; and many a gentleman who had a great <i>stake</i> in the country

quality of which was on a par for excellence with the other good things of
the house.</p>

<p><b>Olympic Theatre.</b>&mdash;Was originally erected by Philip Astley, and opened with
horsemanship, September 18, 1806. The theatre was leased in 1813 to the
celebrated R. W. Elliston. On Monday, November 12, 1821, a dramatised
version of “Tom and Jerry,” by Charles Dibdin, was produced: Tom, Mr.
Blake; Jerry, Mr. Oxberry; Logic, Mr. Vale. Madame Vestris had the
management to 1839, then followed Mr. George Wild, Miss Davenport, and
Watts. The theatre was destroyed by fire March, 1849; re-built and opened
by Mr. Watts, December 26, 1850.</p>

<p><b>Omnibuses.</b>&mdash;The first pair of London omnibuses started from the Yorkshire
Stingo, public-house, in the New Road, to the Bank of England and back, on
Saturday, July 4th, 1829. They were constructed to carry twenty-two
passengers, all inside, and were drawn by three horses abreast. The fare
was one shilling, or sixpence for half the distance, together with the
luxury of a newspaper. A Mr. J. Shillibeer was the owner of these
carriages, and in order that the introduction might have every chance of
success and the full prestige of respectibility, he brought over with him
from Paris two youths, both the sons of British naval officers, and these
young gentlemen were his “conductors.” They were smartly dressed in blue
cloth, after the Parisian fashion. Their addressing any foreign passenger
in French, and the French style of the affair, gave rise to an opinion
that Mr. Shillibeer was a Frenchman, and that the English were indebted to
a foreigner for the improvement of their vehicular transit, whereas Mr.
Shillibeer had served in the British navy, and was born in Tottenham Court
Road; yet he had afterwards carried on the business of a coach builder
both in London and Paris. His speculation was particularly and at once
successful, for he insured punctuality and civility; and the cheapness,
cleanliness, and smartness of his omnibuses were in most advantageous
contrast with the high charges, dirt, dinginess, and rudeness of the
drivers of many of the “short stages” and Hackney coaches, who were loud
in their railings against what they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> pleased to describe as a French
innovation, and many were the street-papers and ballads issued on the

<p class="poem">The ’Buss, the ’Buss, the Omnibus!<br />
That welcomes all without a fuss;<br />
And wafts us on with joyous sound,<br />
Through crowded streets on our busy round,<br />
Reckless of cold and gloomy skies,<br />
Or the driving storm as it downward hies:<br />
Stow’d snug in thee! stow’d snug in thee!<br />
I am where I would wish to be,<br />
While the rain above and the mud below<br />
Affects me not where’er I go&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Though the sleet and the slush be ankle deep,<br />
What matters? while I can ride so cheap!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">What matters? &amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
I love, oh how I love to ride<br />
In cozy converse, side by side,<br />
With some sweet sly enchanting one,<br />
Who lets her little ’larum run<br />
Till scarcely can the listener know<br />
If that or Time more swiftly go!<br />
Henceforth I’ll know the terrible bore<br />
Of “padding the hoof” no more, no more;<br />
But back to his seat I so oft have press’d<br />
I’ll spring, to be wafted the while I rest:<br />
For thou, dear ’Bus! art a home to me,<br />
While I am snugly seated in thee.<br />

<p><b>O.P. and P.S.</b>&mdash;The name given to a tavern in Russell Court, Drury
Lane&mdash;<i>See</i> Kean’s Head&mdash;This sign was construed several ways according as
it suited the different <i>tastes</i> of its visitors. The stage-players took
it in its original sense, to denominate the tavern a theatrical
house;&mdash;and the O.P. and P.S., according to its technicality upon the
stage, thus&mdash;O.P. <i>Opposite Prompter</i>, and P.S. the <i>Prompt Side</i>. The men
of the world placed it in another point of view, “Come and see me
to-night,” said they to a friend, “at the O.P. and P.S., where you will be
sure to meet some <i>Old</i> <span class="smcap">Pals</span>, and hear <i>Prime</i> <span class="smcap">Singing</span>.” And the

<i>Old</i> <span class="smcap">Port</span> and <i>Prime</i> <span class="smcap">Sherry</span>.</p>

<p><b>O.P. Riot.</b>&mdash;When the new Covent Garden Theatre was opened in 1809, the

months a throng crowded the pit shouting O.P. (<i>old prices</i>), much damage
was done, and the manager was obliged at last to give way.</p>

<p><b>Pea-Green Hayne&mdash;Mr.</b>&mdash;He was nicknamed “<i>Pea-green</i>” from his folly in
reference to Miss Maria Foote, afterwards the Countess of Harrington. It
will be remembered that that beautiful and accomplished lady brought an
action against Hayne for breach of promise of marriage, and recovered
3000<i>l.</i> damages; but Hayne was not <i>green</i> upon that account; it was an
affair which the shrewdest man of fashion might have fallen into. If
<i>greenness</i> existed at all in Hayne on that question, it laid in not
marrying her. Fate, however, designed for the lady a better match. The
eccentric Lord Harrington, though a wild, sporting, boxing spirit, as Lord
Petersham, was, as the Earl, one of the most refined gentlemen that ever
added grace to a coronet; and it might be fairly said that his Lordship
did so. Mr Hayne was a man with a mind well stored; he had experience to
aid him. In his association with Ned Baldwin, <i>alias</i> White-headed Bob,

<p><b>Police.</b>&mdash;The London police grew out of the London watch, instituted about
1253; the whole system was remodelled by Mr., afterwards Sir Robert Peel,
by 10 Geo. IV., 19th June, and the New Police commenced duty 29th
September, 1829. Sir Richard Mayne was appointed Chief Commissioner of the
Metropolitan District. The new system was not popular with the people, nor
with those who deemed they had “vested rights,” and the constables were
considered as a target that every one might fire off their chaff and
witticism at with impunity. The terms “Bobby and Peeler”&mdash;after Robert
Peel, immediately became the cant words, together with “Blue Bottles,”
“Blue Devils,” the “Royal Blues; or, the Cook’s Own,” and other opprobious
terms. Within a month of the establishing of the New Police&mdash;viz., on the
14th of October, 1829, one of the members, named John Jones, was charged,
at the Hatton Garden Police-station, with stealing a scrag of mutton, from
the stall-board of a butcher, named Samuel, in Skinner Street, Somer’s
Town. The circumstance having been witnessed by a neighbour, he pursued
the policeman, and took him into custody. He had fifteen shillings and
sixpence in his pocket. In his defence, he said he was going to take the
mutton to show his wife. This was a circumstance that could not be lost
sight of by the Seven Dials printers, and several street-papers and
ballads were immediately issued on the subject, and continued to find a
ready sale for some months; while “Who stole the mutton?” became the
by-word. Following is one of the many ballads that appeared:&mdash;</p>

Police within their territories. “They worn’t a going to hav’ no new
French Police Spy system in their ancient and honourable City,” said
Alderman Cute-Grub-Bub-Turtle-and-Soup, “not if ve knows it.” Therefore,
no one will be surprised at frequently reading in the newspapers of the
period paragraphs like the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW POLICE.</p>

<p>At the Guildhall, on Monday, October 12th, 1829, after Sir Peter
Laurie had admonished and discharged a disorderly woman, who had been
accused of being noisy in the street, he asked her accuser, a
watchman, named Livingstone, where his beat was? The watchman said it
was from St. Dunstan’s Church to Temple Bar. Do you find any increase
of bad characters on your beat? Watchman (smilingly): Yes, I believe I
do; the New Policemen drives ’em into the City. Sir Peter: Then you
should drive them back again; it would be better than taking them up.
Watchman: When there was a quarrel among them the other night, a
policeman came up and drove them through the Bar, saying, “Ye shan’t
stand here; go into the City with your rows.” Sir Peter Laurie said
that he had heard that a police magistrate had directed the policemen
to drive all bad characters into the City. If there was any truth in
this, it was an imprudent&mdash;an improper observation. He desired the
watchman present to drive all the bad characters out of the City. The
thing must be put down. Subsequently, some vagrants were brought up,
and Sir Peter told them to drive them out of the City instead of
apprehending them in future. “We can play at tennis-ball,” said the
Alderman, in an under tone.</p></div>

<p>“Who stole the Mutton?” together with many other words and phrases in
reference to the supposed partiality of the police to <i>The Cook!</i> <i>The
Kitchen!!</i> and <i>The Cold Mutton!!!</i> have clung to the service from the day
of its formation to the present time, while comic writers of all degrees,
in farces, burlesques, songs, and pantomimes, have never failed to make
capital out of the New Police, Peel’s Raw-Lobsters, Peeler’s, Blue
Bottles, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

house, the Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery Lane, March 12th, 1828, aged 34.
Jack was an <i>Anglo-Irishman</i>, and first drew his breath in the Hibernian
colony of St. Giles. He was the hero of sixteen prize battles, and left
the ring undefeated. At this period it was considered he had received not
less than £1,200 by his good fortune, but “easy got, easy gone”&mdash;as fast
as it was got it was spent, until prudence suggested the expediency of
laying the foundation of something substantial for his family, and he
accordingly closed his bargain for the Hole-in-the-Wall, under the
patronage of General Barton, his friends giving him a pipe of wine,
instead of a piece of plate, to commence operations. From henceforth he
pursued the business of a publican, and was highly respected by all ranks
of the <i>Fancy</i>. Tom Moore, the Irish poet, was a frequenter of his house,
and it was there that he picked up most of his material for his “Tom
Cribb’s Memorial to Congress,” &amp;c. The liberality of his friends, however,
added to his own predilection for <i>daffey</i>, gradually paved the way to the
“break-up” of his constitution, and for the last few months of his life he
was but the shadow of his former self.</p>

<p class="poem">Alas! poor Jack lies on his back,<br />

admirable manner in which he played the character of the henpecked cockney
lout in Foote’s farce of “The Mayor of Garratt.” Mr. Russell was for some
years manager of the Theatre Royal, Brighton, where he produced “Tom and
Jerry” in 1822. After a long life of toil and trouble as a manager, actor,
and&mdash;the father of a large family, a charitable benefit was got up for him
at the Haymarket Theatre, July 1st, 1841, when “Macbeth” was performed,
with Charles Kean as Macbeth; Mr. S. Phelps, Macduff; Lady Macbeth, Miss
Ellen Tree. After which Mr. Russell spoke an address thanking his kind
friends and patrons for their support and patronage; explaining that he
deemed it necessary to address them before his final appearance on the
stage, least he should not have the nerve power to do so afterwards. Then
followed <span class="smcap">The Mayor of Garratt</span>, Jerry Sneak (for the last time), Mr.
Russell; Major Sturgeon, Mr. Robert Strickland. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> the money
realized by the Benefit, and the private subscription list, was
injudiciously invested in a very risky security; and a year or two
afterwards the house of business failing the whole of it was irretrievably
lost. Mr. Russell died at his daughter’s residence, Gravesend, February

<p><b>Sadler’s Wells.</b>&mdash;The oldest theatre in London, and named in part from a
mineral spring, which was superstitiously dispensed by the monks of the
Priory of St. John of Jerusalem, from an early date. In the reign of
Charles II. a Mr. Sadler, built here a music-house, and in 1683,
re-discovered while digging gravel for his garden the <i>Holy Well</i> of
“excellent steel water” which in 1684 was visited and drunk by hundreds of
persons of every degree in their morning’s walk. In 1765, Mr. Rosoman
converted Sadler’s Wells garden into a theatre. Mr. King, of Drury Lane
Theatre, was long a partner and stage-manager, and Charles Dibdin and his
sons Thomas and Charles were proprietors. Grimaldi, father, son and
grandson, were famous clowns. The season of 1803 is memorable for the
appearance of the celebrated Italian traveller Signor Benzoni, as the
Patagonian Samson, in which character he performed prodigious feats of
strength. Wine was sold and drunk on the premises until 1807, under the
old regulation,&mdash;“for an additional sixpence, every spectator was allowed
a pint of either port, Lisbon, mountain, or punch.” On the 15th of
October, 1807, twenty three persons, male and female, were killed, and
many dangerously injured by reason of a false alarm of “Fire!” New River
water was introduced in a tank under the stage, and plays were written and
arranged so as to display “Real Water” in some of the scenes, and the
place advertised as the <span class="smcap">Aquatic Theatre Sadler’s Wells</span>. In some cases the
“good young man” and rightful heir to the estate, was basely and
unmercifully hurled from some rock-work into the angry and surging billows
below; by the hired myrmidons of the “Cruel Squire” of the Castle: then it

villagers, for having disgraced the “Village-born Beauty,” who chased him
in and out, and all round about the huge mountain-pass which overhung the

into the “depths below,” and while his <i>dummy!</i> body was descending, it

<p class="poem">There is a pleasure in poetic pains,<br />
Which only Poets know.</p>

<p>“Yonder, sir, is Mr. Goosequill, one of the ‘Seven Bards of the Seven
Dials,’ a clever man, who came to town with half-a-crown in his pocket,
and his tragedy, called the ‘Mines of Peru,’ by which he of course
expected to make his fortune. For five years he danced attendance on the
manager, in order to hear tidings of its being ‘cast,’ and put into
rehearsal, and four years more in trying to get it back again. During the
process he was groaned, laughed, whistled, guyed, and nearly kicked out of
the secretary’s room, who swore&mdash;which well he might do, considering the
exhausted treasury of the concern&mdash;that he knew nothing about, or ever
heard of the ‘Mines of Peru.’ At last Mr. Goosequill, being shown into the
manager’s kitchen, to wait till he was at leisure, had the singular
pleasure of seeing two acts of the ‘Mines of Peru’ daintily fastened round
a savory capon on the spit, to preserve it from the scorching influence of
the fire.</p>

<p>“‘This was <i>foul</i> treatment,’ I observed, and I ventured to ask how he had
subsisted during the meanwhile? ‘Why he first made an agreement with a
printer of Ballads, Last Dying Speeches and Confessions, &amp;c., living in
the Seven Dials, who finding his inclinations led to poetry, expressed his
satisfaction, telling him that one of his poets had lost his senses, and
was confined in Bedlam, and another was dazed with drinking drams. An
agreement was made, and he earned five shillings and
two-pence-three-farthings per week as his share of this speculation with
the muses. But his profits were not always certain. He had often the
pleasure of dining with Duke Humphrey, and for this reason he turned his
thoughts to prose; and in this walk he was eminently successful, for
during a week of gloomy weather he published an <i>apparition</i>, on the
<i>substance</i> of which he subsisted very comfortably for a month. He often
makes a good meal upon a monster. A <i>rape</i> has often afforded him great
satisfaction, but a <i>murder</i>&mdash;an out-and-out <i>murder</i>&mdash;if well timed, is
board, lodging, and washing, with a feast of nectared sweets for many a
day.’”</p>

<p><b>Sketch-Room.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The</span>&mdash;in <span class="smcap">Corinthian House</span> which was principally dedicated to
the productions of the late <span class="smcap">George Morland</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> was rather more if not
quite at home, almost skipping with rapture as his eye ran over the
subjects of that unrivalled genius of the pencil. <span class="smcap">Nature</span> was seen so
strongly at every touch that <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> nearly fancied himself again at
<span class="smcap">Hawthorn Hall</span>, looking at his dogs, pigs, and horses.</p>

<p>“It was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span>, in his remarks to <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, when the
latter first entered this apartment, that if <span class="smcap">Morland</span> had only painted half
the number of subjects which are now before the public, their value might
have been enhanced twice as much; and <i>finished</i> pictures, instead of
<i>sketches</i>, most likely would have been the result. This was the reason
<span class="smcap">Tom</span> assigned to <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> for having it called the <span class="smcap">Sketch-Room</span>. ‘Nine times
out of ten,’ said <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, ‘dull matter-of-fact calculation is not allied with
genius.’ <i>Money</i>, to <span class="smcap">George Morland</span>, was a <i>colour</i> that he did not paint
with; and, therefore, respecting its <i>value</i>, he seemed to know nothing.
<i>Embarrassment</i> and the Catchpoles first drew up the curtain and showed
him the iron bars which stopped his thoughtless career. They also
explained to him, in the most feeling manner, the <i>uses</i> of a strong lock.
They likewise pointed out to <span class="smcap">George</span> the difference in his
<i>prospects</i>,&mdash;not in an artist-like manner to his ‘mind’s eye,’ but in a
clear distinct way of business, that <i>twenty shillings</i> make a <span class="smcap">Pound</span>. For
the <i>moment</i>, he keenly felt the disgusting <i>cramped</i> situation of Carey
Street,<a name='fna_40' id='fna_40' href='#f_40'><small>[40]</small></a> which compelled him to <i>peep</i> at his objects, through the
rails of his apartment: for the <i>moment</i>, also, he felt the immediate
<i>necessity</i> of procuring the gold <i>talismanic</i> key to give him once more
liberty, again to wander amidst the beauties of nature: it was then that
<span class="smcap">Morland</span> painted for <i>money</i>: it was then that <span class="smcap">Genius</span> was in fetters: it
was then that rapid <i>exertions</i> got the better of his <i>taste</i>. ‘The sooner
you paint <i>me</i> a picture, <span class="smcap">Mr. Morland</span>,’ said the <i>leary</i> Bum-trap, ‘the
sooner the door will be open to you. Freedom is in view,&mdash;and I’ll
discharge your debt.’ No skilful angler ever threw his line into waters
with more <i>coaxing</i> bait to hook the poor fish, than Mr. <i>Screw</i> ‘tried it
on’ with his prisoner. It was plausible: it was better,&mdash;it gave no
trouble to his acquaintance: it also prevented <i>shyness</i> or <span class="smcap">Refusal</span> from
his friends. The lock-up-house, by such means lost its terror. Employment
was found for the mind and pencil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> <i>Morland</i>. He experienced no
<i>shiverings</i> of the body&mdash;no feverish <i>parched-up</i> tongue, waiting with
the most anxious suspense for the return of the messenger to bring the <span class="smcap">No</span>,
which ultimately sent him to jail, or the delightful <span class="smcap">Yes</span>, that set the
prisoner once more at liberty. On the contrary, <span class="smcap">George</span> was quite at home.
He did as his inclinations prompted him. Jolly fellows called on him in
abundance; and the song and the glass went round with the freedom of a
tavern. All his wants were supplied, and the <i>misery</i> of a spunging-house
was not seen in <span class="smcap">Morland’s</span> apartments. In fact, he was better attended than
when out of it. From the <i>top screw</i> to the <i>stamper cleaner</i>, all of them
felt an interest in waiting upon the ‘<span class="smcap">Great Genius</span>,’ as he was termed, in
order to take a sly peep at his paintings. <i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> set no price to
his pictures, but when he was tired of his companions, and his confined
situation, he then industriously, and in a short time, <i>painted</i> himself
out of the lock-up house. <i>Lumbering</i> him, never afterwards gave <span class="smcap">Morland</span>
any horrors: and, whenever he was in <i>trouble</i>, the same kind of judgment
was repeated, time and often, till Mr. <i>Screw</i> had realized a tolerable
collection of valuable paintings. This officer was rather fond of
paintings himself; but when any gentleman took a fancy to purchase any of
them, Mr. <i>Screw</i> never betrayed a want of knowledge of their value&mdash;by
the <i>prices</i> he affixed to them. <span class="smcap">Morland</span> died at the premature age of 41,
in October 29, 1804&mdash;dissipated habits proved his <i>quietus</i>.”</p>

<p><b>Soho Bazaar, The.</b>&mdash;The first of its kind in England, was established by
John Trotter, Esq., to whose family it still belongs. The building covers
a space of 300 feet by 150, and extends from the Square to Dean Street on
the one hand, and to Oxford Street on the other. The bazaar occupies two
floors, and has counter accommodation for upwards of 160 tenants. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
principal rooms in the building are about ninety feet long, and in them
the visitor may find almost every trade represented. One large room is set
apart for the sale of books, another for furniture, and another for birds,
cages, &amp;c.; and at one end of the latter room is a large recess, occupied
with a rustic aviary, through which runs a stream of water. Connected with
the bazaar are offices for the registration of governesses and the hire of
servants, &amp;c.; and the scene that here presents itself during business
hours is one well worthy of a visit. The bazaar has been frequently
patronised by royalty.</p>

formerly the “Beggar in the Bush;” in No. 1, Buckeridge Street, within the
classic region the “<i>Holy Land</i>,” or more frequently termed the <i>Rookery</i>
in the heart of St. Giles’. Joe Banks, “mine host” of this boosing-ken;
was a civil, rough, good natured, and very elaborate specimen of the
<i>genus homo</i>, possessing a flow of spirits as extensive as his person.
Good nature and conviviality were his leading characteristics, although
his regular customers were composed of the veriest cadgers both male and
female. The girls without shoes or stockings, clad in rags and jags. The
male cadgers seldom or never used a comb or a pocket handkerchief:&mdash;</p>

will do the handsome thing, I will allow you five minutes to compose your

objects afford me greater satisfaction than the sight of a fine
hunter,&mdash;the view of a high-mettled racer,&mdash;and the look of a <i>perfect</i>
greyhound.’ ‘I admire them also,’ replied the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>; ‘and
<span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span> will always prove an agreeable lounge, if no direct purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
call a person thither. If nothing more than <span class="smcap">Information</span> be acquired, that
<i>alone</i>, <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, to a man of the world, is valuable at all times. Besides,
<span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span> gives a <i>tone</i> to the <i>sporting</i> world, in the same way that
the transactions on the <span class="smcap">Royal Exchange</span> influence the mercantile part of
society. It has likewise its ‘<i>settling days</i>,’ after the great races at
<i>Newmarket</i>, <i>Doncaster</i>, <i>Epsom</i>, <i>Ascot</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> I do not know about the
<i>bulls</i> and <i>bears</i>;<a name='fna_41' id='fna_41' href='#f_41'><small>[41]</small></a> but if it has no <i>lame ducks</i> to <i>waddle</i> out, it
has sometimes <i>Levanters</i> that will not <i>show</i> for a time, and others that
will <i>brush off</i> altogether. But this does not happen very often; and
<span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span> has its ‘<i>good</i> <span class="smcaplc">MEN</span>’ as well as the <i>’Change</i>, and whose
‘<i>word</i>,’ will be taken for any amount. It has also its Subscription-room,
which is extremely convenient for gentlemen and other persons who feel any
inclination to become acquainted with the events of the sporting world, at
the moderate charge of <i>one guinea</i> a year. Indeed,’ continued <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, ‘there
is an air of sporting about this place altogether; elegance, cleanliness,
and style, being its prominent features. The company, I admit, is a
<i>mixture</i> of persons of nearly all ranks in life; but, nevertheless, it is
that sort of <i>mixture</i> which is pleasingly interesting; there is no
<i>intimacy</i> or <i>association</i> about it. A man may be well known here; he may
also in his turn <i>know</i> almost everybody that visits <span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span>; and yet
be quite a <i>stranger</i> to their habits and connections with society. It is
no matter who <i>sells</i> or who purchases at this repository. A <i>bet</i> stands
as good with a <span class="smcap">Leg</span>, and is thought as much of, as with a <span class="smcap">Peer</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Money</span>
being the <i>touchstone</i> of the circumstance. The ‘best judge’ respecting
sporting events is acknowledged the ‘best man’ here; every person being on
the ‘look out’ to see how he <i>lays</i> his <i>blunt</i>. The <span class="smcap">Duke</span> and the
<i>Parliamentary Orator</i>, if they do not know the properties of a horse, are
little more than cyphers; it is true they may be <i>stared</i> at, if pointed
out as great characters, but nothing more. The <i>nod</i> from a
<i>stable-keeper</i> is quite as important, if not more so, to the Auctioneer,
as the <i>wink</i> of a <span class="smcap">Right Honourable</span>. Numbers of persons who visit
<span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span> are, or wish to, appear <i>knowing</i>: from which ‘<i>self</i>’
importance they are often most egregiously duped. In short, if you are not
as familiar with the <i>odds</i> upon all events as <span class="smcap">Chitty</span> in quoting
precedents&mdash;show as intimate an acquaintance with the <i>pedigree</i> and
<i>speed</i> of race-horses as a <span class="smcap">Gulley</span>&mdash;and also display as correct a
knowledge of the various capabilities of the prize pugilists as a
<span class="smcap">Jackson</span>&mdash;if <span class="smcap">Gain</span> is your immediate object, you are ‘of no <i>use</i>’ at
<span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span>,’ ‘Yes,’ said <span class="smcap">Logic</span>, with a grin, interrupting <span class="smcap">Tom</span>; ‘there
are to be found here as many <i>flats</i> and <i>sharps</i> as would furnish the
<i>score</i> of a musical composer; and several of these <i>instruments</i> have
been so much played upon, and are so wretchedly out of <i>tune</i>, that the
most skilful musician in the world cannot restore them to perfect
<i>harmony</i>.’ ‘It is,’ resumed the <span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>, ‘an excellent mart for the
disposal of carriages, horses, dogs, &amp;c., and many a fine fellow’s <i>stud</i>
has been <i>floored</i> by the hammer of <span class="smcap">Tattersall</span>. There is a capacious <span class="smcap">Tap</span>
attached to the premises, for the convenience of servants of gentlemen in
attendance upon their masters, or for any person who stands in need of
refreshment. <span class="smcap">Tattersall’s</span>, for the purposes intended, is the most
complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> place in the Metropolis; and if you have any desire to witness
‘real life’&mdash;to observe <i>character</i>&mdash;and to view the favourite <i>hobbies</i>
of mankind, it is the resort of the <i>pinks</i> of the <span class="smcap">Swells</span>,&mdash;the <i>tulips</i>
of the <span class="smcap">Goes</span>,&mdash;the <i>dashing</i> heroes of the military,&mdash;the fox hunting
clericals,&mdash;sprigs of nobility,&mdash;stylish coachmen,&mdash;smart guards,&mdash;saucy
butchers,&mdash;natty grooms,&mdash;tidy helpers,&mdash;knowing horse-dealers,&mdash;<i>betting</i>
publicans,&mdash;neat jockeys,&mdash;sporting men of all descriptions,&mdash;and the
picture is finished by numbers of real gentlemen. It is the tip-top
sporting feature in London.’ ‘It must have been the work of some time,’
said <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, ‘to have formed such a famous connection.’ ‘Yes,’ replied <span class="smcap">Tom</span>;
‘you are quite right. It is not the <i>work</i> of a day. The name of
<span class="smcap">Tattersall</span> is not only high, but of long standing in the sporting world;
and everything connected with this splendid establishment is conducted in
the most gentlemanly manner. The founder of these premises was during his
time, viewed as one of the best judges of horse-flesh in the kingdom; and,
as a proof of it, he made his fortune by a horse called <span class="smcap">Highflyer</span>.’”</p>

<p><b>West-End Tailor&mdash;A.</b>&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> had just ordered his servant to bring
him ‘<i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>,’ to see how sporting matters had been going on
in the Metropolis during his absence from town, when Mr. Primefit&mdash;the
West-End <i>Schneider</i>!&mdash;<i>Par excellence!</i>&mdash;was announced to <span class="smcap">Mr. Hawthorn</span> to
be in waiting to receive his commands.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span>, according to the ‘<i>counter-talking</i> part of the community,’
had done, all his ‘dirty work;’ and among the <i>needles</i>&mdash;otherwise
<i>sharps</i>&mdash;at the West-end of the Town, who must sport a genteel <i>outside</i>,
no matter at whose <i>suit</i>, it was observed, between a grin and a pun, that
he had not only got rid of all his ‘<i>bad habits</i>,’ but had likewise
outlived his <i>sufferings</i>. It was said of this celebrated ‘apparel
furnisher,’ that, if he received the cash for <span class="smcaplc">ONE</span> coat out of <i>three</i>,
nothing was the matter! In his <i>intercourse</i> with people of fashion, the
character that ran before him was a perfectly gentlemanly tradesman. He
had one <i>point</i> in view on setting out in life, and he never lost sight of
it. To ask his customers for payment was to <i>lose</i> their custom. Though
for the first seven years <span class="smcap">Dickey Primefit</span> was engaged in <i>cutting-up</i> his
cloth, he was <i>hurried</i> beyond <i>measure</i>, by those ‘troublesome
customers,’ <i>John Doe</i> and <i>Richard Roe</i>, who were continually at his
elbow, <i>nudging</i> him to take ‘measure of their suits’ in preference to
every other person; his law expenses and ‘<span class="smcap">Mum</span> <i>tip</i>’&mdash;that is <i>rhino</i> to
<i>silence</i>, or, shut-up the <i>gab</i> of the <i>bum-traps</i>&mdash;in consequence, were
frightful; yet <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> braved the fury of the woollen-draper’s ‘storm’ with
the utmost composure. With a placid countenance he never refused credit to
any British officer, either in the sea or land service, let the distance
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> uncertainty be what it might. The <i>reference</i> of one gentleman to
another was quite sufficient to <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span>; and the <i>garments</i> were made
and sent home without further enquiry or delay. Of course, in return, the
<i>charges</i> of <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> were never overhauled; indeed, what <span class="smcap">Gentleman</span> would
have behaved so <i>ungentlemanly</i> to a tradesman who was all civility,
politeness, and <i>accommodation</i>, from one end of his pattern-card to the
other? The business of <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span>, therefore, became so extensive, that
he sent clothes to all parts of the world. In London, no <i>gentleman</i>, who
had been once in the books of <span class="smcap">Dickey</span>, would listen to the name of any
other tailor, which rendered <span class="smcap">Primefit</span> the ‘<i>go</i> for a tasty cut, best
materials, and first-rate workmanship.’ <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> had a ‘soul above buttons,’
he had no narrow ideas belonging to him: and he flattered himself that,
ultimately, it would <i>all be right</i>. ‘<i>No gentleman</i>,’ <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span> would
often assert, when he has been blamed for giving such an extensive loose
sort of credit, ‘<i>I am convinced, but will act as such, sooner or later</i>,
towards me!’ So it proved. Things, at length, took the expected turn. Many
long out-standing bills came in. His capital accumulated. His business
also increased in so extraordinary a manner that several clerks were
necessary to keep it in order, and ensure punctuality. <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> was almost
as true as a clock to his time, in attending to orders. His character for
fashion was so <i>emphatic</i>, that numbers of stylish tradesmen, who found it
necessary to have a ‘bettermost coat’ by them, for ‘high days and
holidays’ regardless of the charge, employed <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span>. The sunshine of
prosperity was now so complete, that not a single <i>bum-trap</i> had crossed
the threshold of <span class="smcap">Dickey’s</span> door, in the way of <i>private</i> business, for many
a long day past. In short, <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span> had realised the climax of his
exertions&mdash;he had <i>measured</i> his way into a carriage. <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> was
principally distinguished for the <i>cut</i> of his coats. To <span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> he
was peculiarly indebted, as a leader of the fashion. It was owing to this
circumstance that <span class="smcap">Mr. Primefit</span> waited in person at <span class="smcap">Corinthian House</span>;
indeed, the active use of the scissors and parchment had long been removed
from the hands of <span class="smcap">Dickey</span>, and his principal occupation now consisted of
<i>talking</i> over the versatility of fashion to his customers, and giving
directions to his men. But the slightest idea that might drop from
<span class="smcap">Corinthian Tom</span> respecting the advantages of dress was what <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> could
not resist, and he, therefore, ordered his carriage immediately to attend
upon the rustic <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> at once.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, previously to the arrival of the <i>apparel-furnisher</i>, had
been discussing the advantages resulting from <i>dress</i> and <span class="smcaplc">ADDRESS</span>; and the
<span class="smcap">Corinthian</span> had also been pointing out to his Coz not to <i>skim</i> too lightly

<p><b>Wrekin Tavern.</b>&mdash;In Broad Court, Drury Lane, was much frequented by
first-rate theatricals, authors, poets, painters, gentlemen of the press,
men of the world, and intelligent persons in general, and was a house of
entertainment of no common description, kept at the time by a Mr.
Williams, a person connected with literary pursuits. It was to the Wrekin
Tavern that Edmund Kean was conveyed on the ever-memorable night of the
24th of March, 1833, when he partly played Othello to his son Charles’s
Iago, at Covent Garden Theatre. And described thus by his biographer:&mdash;</p>

<p>“After making one or two feeble steps towards his son, and attempting the
speech of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Villian, be sure thou prove my love a whore;<br />
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“When his head sunk on his son’s shoulder, and the tragedian’s acting was
at an end. He was able to groan out a few words in Charles’s ear&mdash;‘I am
dying&mdash;speak to them for me;’ after which (the audience refusing in
kindness, to hear any apology) he was borne from the stage. His son,
assisted by other persons, carried him to his dressing-room, and laid him
on a sofa. He was as cold as ice; his pulse was scarcely perceptible; and
he was unconscious of all that was going on around him. In this state he
remained some time, when the remedies which were applied having restored
him to his senses, he was taken to the ‘Wrekn’ Tavern, near the theatre,
and Messrs. Carpue and Duchez, the surgeons, were sent for. From the
Wrekin Tavern, he was after a week’s stay, removed to Richmond: where he
died on the fifteenth day of May, 1833.”</p>

<p>The Wrekin Tavern&mdash;the Times&mdash;and the Proprietors underwent many changes
from good, bad, and very indifferent; in fact, the character of house and
company was entirely altered&mdash;<i>O tempora! O mores!</i> Here Johnny Broome,
the pugilist, who was born at Birmingham, 1817, and the successful hero of
six or seven battles in the P.R., and also the prime mover in “The Great
Brighton Card Cheating Case,” committed suicide by cutting his throat, May
31, 1855.</p>

fight was with Molineux, a black, for £600, at Thistleton Gap, September
28, 1811. Presented by the Sporting World with a cup of the value of
eighty guineas, December 2, 1811, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn. Which he
received from the hands of Mr. Emery, the comedian, who made the following
complimentary address:&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Thomas Cribb</span>, I have the honour this day of being
the representative of a numerous and most respectable body of your
friends; and though I am by no means qualified to attempt the undertaking
which has devolved on me, by a vote of the subscribers, yet the cause
will, I am confident, prove a sufficient excuse for my want of ability.
You are requested to accept this <span class="smcap">Cup</span>, as a tribute of respect for the
uniform valour and integrity you have shown in your several combats, but,
most particularly, for the additional proofs of native skill and manly
intrepidity displayed by you in your last memorable battle, when the cause
rested not merely upon individual fame, but for the pugilistic reputation
of your native country, in contending with a formidable foreign
antagonist. In that combat you gave proof that the innovating hand of a
foreigner, when lifted against a son of Britannia, must not only be aided
by the <i>strength</i> of a <span class="smcap">Lion</span> but the <span class="smcap">Heart</span> also.</p>

<p>“The fame you have so well earned has been by manly and upright conduct,
and which I have no doubt will ever mark your very creditable retirement
from the ring or stage of pugilism. However intoxicated the <i>cup</i> or its
<i>contents</i> may at any future period make you, I am sufficiently persuaded
the gentlemen present, and the sons of John Bull in general, will never
consider you have a <i>cup</i> too much.”</p>

<p>Tom Cribb took a farewell benefit under the auspices of the Pugilistic
Association, at the National Baths, Westminster Road, November 12, 1840.
Died in High Street, Woolwich, May 11, 1848. Monument erected to his

West</i>&mdash;was held at the Coach and Horses public house, Nightingale-lane,
East Smithfield, which was kept by a person of the appropriate name of
<span class="smcap">Mace</span>. Here it required no patronage;&mdash;a card of admission was not
necessary; no enquiries were made, and every <i>cove</i> that put in his
appearance was quite welcome, colour or country considered no obstacle;
and <i>dress</i> and <span class="smcap">Address</span> completely out of the question. <i>Ceremonies</i> were
not in use, therefore no struggle took place at <span class="smcap">All-Max</span> for the master of
them. The parties <i>paired off</i> to <i>fancy</i>; the eye was pleased in the
choice, and nothing thought of about birth and distinction. <i>All was
happiness!</i>&mdash;every body free and easy, and freedom of expression allowed
to the very echo. The group motley indeed;&mdash;Lascars, blacks, jack tars,
coalheavers, dustmen, women of colour, old and young, and a sprinkling of
the remnants of once fine girls, &amp;c. were all <i>jigging</i> together, provided
the <i>teazer of the catgut</i> was not <i>bilked</i> out of his <i>duce</i>. <i>Gloves</i>
might have been laughed at, as dirty hands produced no <i>squeamishness</i> on
the heroines in the dance, and the scene changed as often as a pantomime,
from the continual introduction of new characters. <i>Heavy wet</i> was the
cooling beverage, but frequently overtaken by <i>flashes of lightning</i>.</p>

<p>“I am quite satisfied in my mind, said <span class="smcap">Logic</span> to <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, it is the <span class="smcap">Lower
Orders</span> of society who really enjoy themselves. They eat with a good
appetite, <i>hunger</i> being the sauce; they <i>drink</i> with zest, in being
<i>thirsty</i> from their exertions, and not <i>nice</i> in their beverage, and, as
to <i>dress</i>, it is not an object of serious consideration with them. Their
minds are daily occupied with work, which they quit with the intention of
<i>enjoying</i> themselves, and <i>enjoyment</i> is the result; not like the rich,
who are out night after night to <i>kill</i> time, and what is worse,
dissatisfied with almost every thing that crosses their path, from dulness
of <i>repetition</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is too much truth about your argument, I must admit,” replied
<span class="smcap">Corinthian</span>; “and among the scenes that we have witnessed together, where
the <span class="smcap">Lower Order</span> have been taking their <i>pleasure</i>, I confess they have
appeared <span class="smcaplc">ALL HAPPINESS</span>. I am sorry I cannot say as much for the higher
